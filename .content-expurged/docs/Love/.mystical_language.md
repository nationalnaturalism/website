### Language

#### Saussure and linguistics

We believe strongly that the very nature of language will change in time, reflecting the level of collective inspiration, changing their very thought processes and thus perception of reality, as per the Sapir-Wolf hypothesis. The nature of language has been the subject of treaties and philosophical musings for all of written history. Ferdinand de Saussure, son of modern linguistics, defines language as following:

```quote{cite="Cours de linguistique général, 1916" .aside}
Among all the individuals that are linked together by speech, some sort of average will be set up : all will reproduce — not exactly of course, but approximately---the same signs united with the same concepts.
```

He defined [language, written or oral](DFN), as a series of related symbols following a syntax and refering unequivocally to a series of equally related concepts following same relationships. Unambiguous sentence show a biunivoque relationship between that series of signs or signififiers (what we use to represent concepts) and signified (the mental notions we associate with things). Later we named [morphemes](DFN "smallest meaning-carrying units") his signs, defining them as the smallest meaning-carrying units, applying to written as well as oral lanugages, in which cases signs correspond to a chain of sounds - bounded and structured by articulation and pauses - within the greater speech. And while each person makes its contribution to language by its imperfect learning and making others used to those idiosynchrasies[^s], individuals grow in those social conventions in contact with their parents, teachers, coworkers, etc.
Saussure posited two key posulates, which while arguably of limited practical interests in his science, have far reaching philosophical andontological consequences:
1. [Concepts as learnt patterns](DFN)
We create concepts as an exterior delimitation imposed on the stream of perception with the help of preexisting concepts. They are merely more or less defined patterns extracted from raw mental impressions, with the help of other concepts. While not completely arbitrary, *they exist only through associations with each other*. A conditioned, co-dependent arising.
2. [The arbitrariness of signs](DFN)
Due to the analogy between signs and signifiers, signs too (loosely speaking, written or spoken words) depending on a core of elementary words who definitions can not avoid involving each others in a circular fashion. These associations between concepts and words, are conventional, we could call all cats <q>dogs</q> and the other way around and be none the wiser, as know all those who've had to contend with several closely related idioms or patois... There is noting more fickle than the meaning of words. *Ergo, the association of words and what they mean is purely accidental*, conventional. It is **arbitrary**.

There are a few standard counter-arguments, the existence of onomatopea being one: the imitation of *natural sounds* to remind of a given situation or thing. However they are very few in number, and so low in information they most always form part of the *paralanguage or vocalics*, outside grammar and syntax, and not proper words. They don't do more than recalling a mental image of this or that, hence not influencing language at large since the overwhelming majority of concepts which forms constute our inner mental life are too abstract to remind of a sound. Beside, for "immediate" _imitations of animal sounds_, they vary actually vary a lot from country to country.
One could argue that vision is for humans a more important sense field to relate to the world, as we can literally draw the things we refer to, with *pictograms* or the *ideograms* they historically evolve into. But just the same, non-visual concepts, let alone complex ones involving past and future just can not be depicted with any hope of immediate, transcultural comprehension. Only the simplest visual referents. Meaning, **pictograms are actually always conventional**, however well designed and thought-out[^worse].

Even in a rather naturalistic/primitive world without much of a material culture or technology, the intricacy of human thoughts still demands a complex grammars with plenty of of non-abstract concepts, making the development of syntactic elements void of semantics and conventional symbols an inevitability. **Yet Saussure and everyone else are wrong.**

[^worse]: Worse: alleguedly ideographic writing systems (Chinese and Egyptian) heavily use common symbols *solely for their their conventional phonetic value*, so we end up with something infinitely worse and more indirect than an alphabet !

#### The esoteric side of culture

The errors lie in two hidden assumptions:
- the conception of people as *social beings first and foremost, born with little to no inborn representations (fantasies) and mental categories*.
- their *materialism* (the inexistence or insignificance of extrasensory perception)

It is proven and relatively acknowledged now, that we are born with innate representations regarding natural life, the conditions within which we evolved and which helped us survive in so far as we had no yet straw away from nature, through civilization and sedentarity. Sound and sight of predators, sexual scenes, an intuitive understanding of body language, even of animals as distantly related to us as birds. We are born with hardwired categories which while not being concepts in and of themselves, limit the range of ideas we are susceptible to get in any given situation, to those put to the test by our ancestors and the necessity of survival in our prehuman past.

However, if our thoughts are limited by our hardware and "factory settings", it doesn't mean their expression would bear any great similarity from one culture to another or that these settings would be sufficiently precise in our head to serve as the basis of an universal language.
**Not alone, that is.**

We posit that visions, extrasensory perception in general, prove the existence of a direct mental connection to the essence of things. Traditions all over the world have talked of the mystical power of words and language, beliefs collectively categorized as <q>prerational</q>, magical superstitious thinking, and are traditionally thought as the hallmark of <q>primitives</q>, before the light of reason had instated science as the new god.
What if there was a truth to that, and if so, what would be the consequences ?
What if knowing "true" names of things was more than a myth ?

The idea certainly pervades all inspired cultures, in Asia and the West, in the Bible, Plato and Tolkien alike. While it appears many writing system own their development from the needs of an evergrowing bureaucratic machine and comptability, a good many also seem linked to religion and stayed religious for long, if not their whole existence, such as Egyptian hieroglyphs and many african scripts. At the surprise of specialists, when attempting to translate them, Linear B tablets (script used by Mycenians, ancestors of ancient greeks, between c. 1400 BC – 1200 BC) fortunately burnt within temples and thus preserved until, showed scores upon scores of religious prose instead of administrative records in service of a very imposing bureaucracy as supposed believed until then !

A superficial look at history suffices to prove discourses carry a timeless energy, in speeches or books, like a radio program whose waves could reach receivers instantly, beyond time and space. This energy pushes peoples into action, enacting metapsychic order onto to reality. Be it from one lovely Math teacher or Hitler transfigurating untold millions, inspired people transform mere words into proper archetypes, imbuing them with an inherent meaning which seems to jump at your face on its own, speaking directly to the heart and greatly facilitating comprehension.

Energy simply demands **exposition to symbols**, and although the more immersive - **intimate** - the better, writing carries the same energy-information just as easily. Energy lets us to choose the right concepts with the right words in the exact same order to impart understanding not explained by mere simple textual meaning or logical coherence, producing a properly magical effect.

And a culture of overall inspired people, closer to true love, produce inspired languages which in their very grammatical structure and vocabulary, reflect that proximity to the archetypes's eternal reality, more than do other languages.

Surely, uninspired languages can stay useful in day to day life, but only rarely overcome social conventions, the culturally-conditioned ideas we form about things. They hardly ever have that effect of short-circuit cultural boundaries and concepts themselves, to open our mind to the unchangeing core of human experience, even less transcendent reality. Communication itself looses much of its strength and such a culture strays away from sane paths, into excessive intellectualization or empty emotionality.
**Languages has become truly Saussurian with its utterly conventional and arbitrary nature.**

## The inborn aspect of language

The lasting observation of blind children demonstrated that language is not learnt from the environment, but come alive with inborn biases and primitive cognitive structures to make sense of them despite deficiencies in our [sensorium](DFN "Le sensorium désigne la somme des perceptions d’un organisme et le siège de la sensation, à partir duquel le sujet expérimente et interprète les environnements dans lesquels il vit.")  with. We do **not** learn to associate words with meaning through experiences, that association downs on us from within.
Logically, if language was purely a matter of pattern matching with exposition and repetition, misunderstandings could create an entirely alien language relative the one we try to learn[^book]. Moreover, the simple exposition to context, or any number of them figuring the thing to be given definition, could mean absolutely anything to a truly ignorant, neutral observer. A succession of the same animal (\`cat\`) in a context could lead not to the animal with its common characteristics being extracted from the scenes as a common denominator, but as the word \`cat\` meaning a process or phenomena, in which the animal may not even be understood as its own entity or object. And the use of another word (\`dog\`) in a different but similar may be understood as the \`cat\` *changing* with a new name and new look.

But language learners *of any age* do not make these mistakes a computer (or alien) could, *because we are not intuitively wired to project these thought patterns*, and further linguistic cues confirm that it is not the meaning intended. The intended meaning is apparent to children immediately, even though they could equally pick from a big number of nonsensical ones.

```quote {cite="Language and Experience Evidence from the Blind Child" author="Barbara Landau, Lila R. Gleitman"}
For the theory of observation-based learning is vacuous unless it specifies two components: It must elucidate the vocabulary in which experience is couched, and it must specify *an inductive machinery that is somehow sensitive to the impoverishment and degeneracy of the information it receives*.
As will be shown, blind children begin to speak rather late, though within the normal range[...](#) By the third birthday, they are virtually indistinguishable from their sighted peers. *This is a beginning indication that *conceptual tendencies* in blind and sighted learners act to *override adventitious differences in their experiential base**.
```

Today most specialists agree that we are born with an innate list of semantic relationships and primary mental categories which are subsets of the set of all possile concepts the human mind can fathom, which is presumed infinite. With that list we make sense of both our languageand the sensory world and for many work centers on expanding that list, that genetic mental map by finding the common denominators in all languages (not just linguistic) and its genesis in animals.

**However**, if the notion of an universal grammar is unavoidable, beside it would have to work with hearing and touch input as much it does with the visual field of perception, so much so that blind children and mute children can learn language just as well as unimpaired ones, in the same time, with no deficit. Despite the sense of hearing having no connection with most abstract or visual properties. Similarly while the sense of touch can provide a spatial representation regards to depth, relief and positioning, concepts of things too far, big or diffuse to be touched are not accessible with any degree of immediacy (where does a mountain stop ?). And beside, many concepts bear no intuitive relationship with any **visual** scene either[^abstract], yet we get them very early on, they must then come from innate predispositions.
Computer language models, such as ChatGPT, which have been shown capable to derive adequate spacial relationships from a mere though extremely extensive database of linguistic samples, are likely to function very differently from the human mind. Such methodology would imply comparing constantly, an immense quantity of phrases, or visual cues, symbols or auditory conversations, or any kind of media susceptible to convey a language. And the inborn rules of inference (mental patterns) mentioned above, would have to span not just the visual but also aural and tactile field alike.

Considering we are talking of **infants** assuming this amount of computation is downright silly. And as the book explains, in the early years we would expect very diverse mistakes and results depending on the pedagogies used, which is to say the child's database of conversations. But we don't, with the exception of cases of mental impairment, acquisition of the language happens remarkably uniformly throughout the world.
As do anyone, people whose perception differ from the norm in any way will communicate in a way that mirrors their own perceptual habits or depivations, but it appears those difficulties are only of a developmental nature: the meaning is well grasped, it is just its application to specific contexts *labelling* the concepts which is more challenging, until the child develops the cognitive faculties useful to fill his lack of experience, so that even the understanding of [colors](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8379969/), which should elude him forever, develop identically. 

So we are forced to consider that in humans (and to a certain measure, animals) the fundamentals of language are acquired not through computations and comparisons, but through the inherent connection of consciousness to the plane of archetypes, which then imbue the existing linguistic content of our brain and guide its association with the sensorium. For an infant, this content is no more than our inborn universal grammar, and in adults whatever he already learnt or is familiar with... pretty much how visions work[^man]. Without that extrasensory element learning language would be not just slower, but impossible.

The idea of an original language of a time when men could [freely talk with gods and spiritual forces](https://www.theosophical.org/publications/quest-magazine/4114-the-tongue-of-angels "The tongue of the Angels") has pervaded our culture since before Christianity. Many tried recreating it, either in all seriousness by scientists and philosophers[^scientist], by occultists through visions or merely suggest artistically some primeval origin in fictional works (Tolkien or more recently Star Trek's plethora of authors), series or Japanese animes, often with aliens standing in  for angels.

The loss of that original language in many a culture, often comes from some event signing humanity's Fall from God's grace, being tainted by arrogance, pride or another fashionable sin. While the overwhelming majority of those artificial languages hardly tried to hide their taking inspiration from older and/or more inspired languages such as Greek and Egyptian hieroglyphs (see the obvious Egyptian influence in *Fushigi no Umi no Nadia*), the same force has been pushing forth for all of written history.

Daniel Belrichard, at 18 years, between 1979 and 1980, one of Mr Burger's lovers at the same of the Trois Noyers in Switzerland (a community before much of the theoretical development of metapsychoanalysis had taken place), received a series of vision totalizing adding up to six pages of thirty symbols, so about two hundreds of them, only stopping due to incoming stops due to unfortunate events.. Mr Burger thinks it would have gone into the low hundreds. All different signs, of various complexity, made of curved and straight lines and dots or circles. *As dishonest a tale as it may sound*, the notebook that housed those visions was lost in the mayhem surrounding the Swiss trial for staturory rape (relationship with a minor, a mixed race girl named Maffalda) which incidentally saw the judge acknowledging the affair as a loving relationship, far from a violent rape.

Fascinated by this story I tried to come up with facsimile shamelessly taking inspiration from the X-files series, with limited results. These second-hand copies made decades after were acknowledged as good approximation of some glyphs, the simplest ones that is.

![Second-hand attempt to repeat those symbols](/Images/spirituality/mystical_alphabet/our_script/symboles.webp "second-hand approximation")

The closest graphical equivalent, are not found in any real life script, but in a few TV series and Japanese animes, whose authors manage to channel and breath metapsychic power into his words. While no concept nor syllabe or word appeared to come along these symbols, their numbers would rather match a **grammar-less completely composable ideogrammatic system** in which new or advanced (perhaps less natural) concepts can be accomodated or composed. It cannot be overstated, how that loss underappreciated at the time, was ruefully felt years after.

The best all-round approximation in all litterature (fictional and historical), in fact complex than what was received, appeared in One Piece, with the Poneglyphs, indestructible rocks inscribed with the history of the world for future generations by *a hyper-advanced lost civilization to which science and technology were one and the same*, but which lost a war and was erased from all records by their enemies.

Something like that would have extreme density of information, ease of writing by hand and a great composability to coin new glyphs for new concepts on the fly. And paradoxically, a simple but completely extensible, fixed and non-ambiguous grammar like that of Bliss would fit computers and AIs very well, not unlike the Culture's own writing in Ian Banks' books. I can think of one graphical system was invented, which might ressemble remotely in its overall principles (clearly not the symbols though !) and strangeness what we envision:

## Blissymbols

```quote{cite="[Blissymbolics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blissymbols)"}
The 900 individual symbols of the system are called <q>Bliss-characters</q>; these may be <q>**ideographic**</q> – representing abstract concepts, <q>pictographic</q> – a direct representation of objects, or <q>composite</q> – in which two or more existing Bliss-characters have been superimposed to represent a new meaning. Size, orientation and relation to the <q>skyline</q> and <q>earthline</q> affects the meaning of each symbol.

A single concept is called a <q>Bliss-word</q>, which can consist of one or more Bliss-characters.

In the case of multiple character Bliss-words, the main character is called the <q>classifier</q> which <q>indicates the semantic or grammatical category to which the Bliss-word belongs</q>.

To this can be added Bliss-characters as prefixes or suffixes called <q>modifiers</q> which amend the meaning of the first symbol.

A further symbol called an <q>indicator</q> can be added above one of the characters in the Bliss-word (typically the classifier); these are used as <q>grammatical and/or semantic markers.
```
Such a means of communication would embody the rébus principle to the fullest but without the detriment of being too precise... by using abstract representations of universal logic concepts at the basis of human cognition, and bypassing completely the reference to orality thus the use of a constraining syntax (<q>In linguistics, the grammar of a natural language is its set of structural constraints on speakers' or writers' composition of clauses, phrases, and words</q>). The absence of grammar in the usual sense also permits the concentration of the totality of semantic content in the vocabulary, the symbols themselves, which can then be freely shifted from one place to another without any alteration to produce an infinitely varied amount of meanings.

Most often, a stream of consciousness from the Collective Unconscious does preside at their inception, but then runs out and the author continues the development regardless on the basis of a dry formal intellectual pursuit, or a sense of duty perhaps. With time (or immediately !) this leads to the gradual misunderstanding of the author's original intents, misuse of the system, tools or school of thought he brought up, and eventual degeneracy of said inspired products by the successive generations, until nothing remains of its original value.

This is precisely how languages <q>evolve</q>, that is to say, **degenerate**. Successive generations understand less and less what their parents and grandparents thought or the world they lived in or what they felt, or the meaning of their words. As an example the French word <q>étonné</q> now conveying a **slight** disappointment or surprise, originally meant (in the XVIIth century) feeling as if **struck by lighting** (from *tonnerre*, thunder). A very common case of *erosion of meaning*.   

The history of most languages provide a sorry display of that tendency. Philologic studies show how the anterior state of many <q>high culture</q> languages were actually **superior** to their later states, even if those civilizations often reached their material and territorial peak afterwards. Cases in hand, the number and distinctiveness of grammatical cases, aspects and tenses in Greek, Latin and Sanskrit, **going up and not down** as we go back in time, alluding to more sophisticated and intelligent forebears. Modern grammars find <q>blurry</q>, incomprehensible concepts that were perfectly clear to contemporaries such as the *middle voice*[^today].

But how can we know those particular concepts chosed as primitives, really correspond to that of the human brain ?
{.important}

Beside, originators can well be outstanding inspired individuals, but that doesn't mean just anybody can use or appropriate their creation as they wish, with good intentions or not, lacking the same connection to the magical connection, even when the endproduct is intellectual in nature, we can not disconnect that tool from the stream of consciousness that possessed the inventor, and which might permeated its structural characteristics, resulting in improved functionality (ease of communication in that case, alleguedly).

Plato's thoughts went far and wide, but centuries later neo-platonicists didn't understand a damn thing of what he said, nor did anyone else for the matter, including his closest disciple, Aristotle, who was the flattest materialist of the time, not getting a single thing about love, mediumnic abilities, divine intelligence or anything his master taught with pristine clarity. He even explained sexual inclinations in mechanical, pneumatic terms. The intellect requires a level of inspiration to hit at a target, even from the borrowers of a thought or tool.

Funnily enough this issue marred Blissymbolics' development history, providing an adequate case in point. While the man had his character he clearly ambitioned something unique, a purely symbolic system that would help children with learning difficulties *because* of its unique take on communication, instead of being *built as a clutch for English and English only*. A new way of thinking discarded by *petty-thinking, narow-minded therapists*.
```quote{cite="Wikipedia"}
Since the 1960s/1970s, Blissymbols have become popular as a method to teach disabled people to communicate. In 1971 Shirley McNaughton started a pioneer program at the Ontario Crippled Children's Centre (OCCC), aimed at children with cerebral palsy, from the approach of augmentative and alternative communication (AAC). According to Arika Okrent, *Bliss used to complain about the way the teachers at the OCCC were using the symbols*, in relation with the proportions of the symbols and other questions: for example, they used <q>fancy</q> terms like <q>nouns</q> and <q>verbs</q>, to describe what Bliss called <q>things</q> and <q>actions</q> (Okrent, Arika (2009), In the land of invented languages). The _ultimate objective of the OCCC program was to use Blissymbols as a practical way to teach the children to express themselves **in their mother tongue**_, since the Blissymbols provided visual keys to understand the meaning of the English words, especially the abstract words.

In his work Semantography Bliss had not provided a systematic set of definitions for his symbols, _so McNaughton's team might often **interpret** a certain symbol in a way that Bliss would later criticize as a <q>misinterpretation</q>_. For example, they might interpret a tomato as a vegetable —_according to the English definition_ of tomato— even though the ideal Blissymbol of vegetable was restricted by Bliss to just vegetables growing underground. Eventually _the OCCC staff modified and adapted Bliss's system_ in order to make it **serve as a bridge to English**.(2009, p. 189) Bliss' complaints about his symbols <q>being abused</q> by the OCCC became so intense that the director of the OCCC told Bliss, on his 1974 visit, never to come back.

## One brain, one Reich, *one language*

But the biggest flaw underlying all others, is the lack of extrasensory.
{.important}

It is true that the human brain is wired with predetermined categories, tendencies to process events things and feelings in certain ways. But human instincts are enormously complexity, compared to most animals. And humans' absolutely unique attribute is to tackle all problems **with symbolic manipulation**. We are not wired for specific, concrete situations, but to encompass any new one with our big brain's ability to make sense of everything, while other species might very much beat us in some tasks with twenty times less resource (in term of brain weight, volume or number of neurons) but only there. Such intelligences make use of highly honed instinctive and incredibly sophisticated neural pathways tailored for their specialized lifestyle since millions of years, while we went another route, developping a general abstract intelligence.

Our brain is made to tune in to a continuous stream of **absolute, immanente knowledge**. We should not try to figure out the truth via a trial and process, it should reveal itself with total certitude, from the vintage point of God. Because this is our highest, most evolved and unique ability (not the extrasensory per se, but its channelling through abstract, symbolic thinking) it stands to reason our genetic instincts and **hardwired brain settings would expect the organic development of such abilities**.
Even in a functioning system the flaws of replacing immanente intuition with systematic but artificial rules to derive meaning appear rather obvious:
```quote
Blissymbols were an “invented” system with a specific logic on how to derive meaning, it was unrealistic to expect a response from a naive subject that matched the Blissymbolics Communication Insti- tute’s (BCI) derivation. In addition, earlier studies (Yovetich & Paivio, 1980) suggested that for naive subjects, the hit rate increased if synonyms of the BCI derivatives were accepted.

[...](#) Thus, symbol guessability decreases as a function of the stimulus attributes. That is, Blissymbols rated high on representativeness and representing highly concrete words (HRHC) were correctly named significantly more often than symbols rated high on representativeness, but representing low concrete (or abstract) words (HRLC).

[...](#) The psychological variable of concreteness of the word label was studied because it has been previously demonstrated that the concreteness of a stimulus correlates positively with performance on a variety of tasks that are relevant to memory studies
```
That simply highlights what we said, that only truly picturesque glyphs can be representative. Abstract base glyphs are purely arbitrary, while concrete ones might make a lot of sense but *afterwards*, when we learn their definition. it still helps with remembering vocabulary though, a key goal of Bliss' design, although how much is debatable.

From my point of view the difficulty in writing and reading with any measure of speed seems **big**, both practically (characters not being nearly as streamlined and quick to type or write than an alphabet) and conceptually, the latter owning partly to the lack of culture. Unlike natural ideographic languages like Chinese, the number of acknowledges words (both primitive symbols and combined ones, their <q>words</q>) is **small**. To convey new information is always to pour new water into old vases. The more we discard extralinguistic cues (let alone extrasensory), the less context we provide, the more borrow common, conventional speechs patterns - and the corresponding thought patterns - to communicate. But this issue may be amplified many times over with Bliss or similar attempts for two reason:
- the lack of common patterns to borrow when there is no written culture to draw expressions and styles of speechs from
- and worse here, the very freedom and open grammar ingrained in its design might slow understanding considerably, because natural language includes a lot of contextual information in the choice of styles, synonymes and alternative (differing as to **complex connotations**, not in the primary sense) grammatical constructs, all stemming closely from the language's **constraints**.

Forcing. constraint-free systems not backed up by its own expansive litterature, to literally <q>spell it all out</q> in potentially a very unnatural way, lest for vagueness and ambiguity **slowing down reading considerably** for anything more than surface level exchanges, far from the incredible force of a poem, erudite discourse or a lawyer's plea.

The solution - if indeed a solution it is - consists in reinjecting a big dose of extralinguistic context through the extrasensory, providing - theoretically - both the total adequacy of a message made in literal heaven for its intended purpose (the hallmark of archetypal symbols, fitting) and the access to an infinite repository of idioms and styles. We would not rely anymore on a finite and often potentially antidated list of [writing patterns](https://owl.excelsior.edu/orc/what-to-do-after-reading/analyzing/writing-patterns/) most of us forgot where we took them from, on the instant symbolic resonance between the situation and the message needed.

Because archetypal symbols are *both the lock and the key*, the cipher and the code, just like the genetic code encodes in itself the very rules to read it. Giving by the way an almost unquantifiable density, but unlike with DNA *storage space in the soul is really infinite*[^gene]. The fundamental difference between inspired speeches and normal ones, is that even if the length of page, size and resolution of characters, or duration of speeches are all limited, but the information does not lie in the physical medium nor in our brain.

But these only serve as triggers to pull it out of the other dimension, to <q>remember<q> it - as Plato would say - from **our memories of tomorrow**.
{.important}

Hence while animal languages (save for dolphins and maybe elephants) are entirely determined genetically, with a fixed number vocalisations (even an elementary grammar) inherited and fixed at birth (hence, limited to the range of predators/preys/situations the ancestors encountered) our languages and precategories must be strikingly different, not less precise but infinitely more flexible and polyvalent, *relying on the extrasensory to fill them in*.

And so, visions should provide the names, nouns verbs or what ever kind of linguistic concepts we should be using, and the understanding of such a mystical script would make greater use of psychic abilities than ordinary languages, in order to evoke the ultimate reality behind concepts. In effect, a form of telepathy through a medium, finally breaking the shackles on the human mind.

We think this essential part of us nearly obliterated since the mesolithics (cooking), the reduction in brain size and completely so since the Industrial Revolution, coupled with our intelligence then much higher than now, allowed Neanderthal ancestors to speak the true names of things, sharing a single language throughout the planet *since this one would stem directly from our genetic data and deep brain structures*, which Neanderthals and most likely their equally long-lived closely related Denisova cousins shared all around the planet.

Thus, one can speculate, that language maybe used to evolve not on the scale of centuries, but tens if not a hundred thousand years, **along with our genetics and our slowly changing consciousness**. As the pure expression of our brain's creative faculties, such a language would be able to encompass the totality of possible human experience, by relying on *visionary interpretation*.

Now, whether this used to apply to complete languages or only a big common linguistic substrate making translation and learning much easier if not downright instantaneous due to both higher IQs and *what amounts to telepathy*, or if it included written symbols the kind of Mr. Burger and Daniel Belrichard received, further instructions are awaited. But that these symbols were <q>true</q> and a gift from the gods to help mankind ascend to their former self, is a certitude to us.  

[^s]: <q>A mode of behaviour or way of thought peculiar to an individual.</q>
[^gene]: Unless a lot of what we suppose material in genetic inheritance, comes from the spiritual dimension too, as Rupert Sheldrake claimed, and we tend share this opinion if not necessarily how he implemented his idea with protein unfoldings. 
[^man]: That is to say, inherent to a functioning brain, is some spiritual connection, however mute and minimal, and however depraved or evil or uninspired the person might be. Strictly speaking a soulless man would be dead.

How is the learner to realize that the linguistic encoding (the particular sentence spoken) is of one of these descriptions of the scene and not the other?

	Looking at the mentioned classical languages, you will find it is not necessarily the languages themselves that appear to be complete and precise, it is (if anything) the rule sets. I cannot see much precision in the blurry subtle distinction between the Greek or Sanskrit active vs. middle voice, discerning the degree of involvement of the actor in the action. (Not talking about the reflexive meaning, I am talking about <q>I am doing something</q> vs. <q>I am doing something in my own interest</q>). Most language descriptions also don’t get much further than stating that it is blurry…

	Classical Latin is on the surface more <q>structured</q> by its grammar, which paradoxically also made the *syntax freer that it is in any modern Romance language*: Look at the writings of Cicero. I don't have the time at the moment to hunt down some examples, except for <q>magna cum laude,</q> which means literally <q>big-(ablative) with praise-(ablative) [or is it dative??]</q> which means loosely <q>with great praise</q>.

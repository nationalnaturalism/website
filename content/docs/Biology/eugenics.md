In this page we present a synthesis of all our general conceptions about evolution, genetics and heredity. Even to those with little knowledge of genetics or biology, or perhaps even more importantly to them, as they have not been formatted by the mainstream ideology.
Biology, ecology and everything to do with evolution, is filled to the brim with materialistic doctrines of a quasi-religious nature, that don't say their name but camouflage as objective science. The core of this religion, is the belief that evolution (by extension, nature) is purposeless and meaningless, as meaningless as life itself.
True science has to be berated, silenced or willfully ignored, and the public, throught the media and school manuals, misinformed and lied to, in order to hide the many facts and discoveries not compatible with the neodarwinist religion that teachers and physicians preach.

What I want is to uncover the ideological underpinnings of the modern neo-darwinist synthesis, and provide a comprehensive, all-inclusive alternative that is at once justify a lot if not all of what teach, regards to diet, pathogens and incest. To create that final perspective, to understand natural laws, the only things that were needed, were the intellectual propensity to reject no fact how strange and inconvenient they may be, and think along the lines of reasoning that decades of experience of instinctotherapy and unsurpassed healing proved true.
Finally this will also consitute the most thorough and fundamental defense of scientific racism ever produced, and at the end, you shall be privy to a practical plan to bring back our species to the past biological perfection of our ancestors.

## Genetics

### Basic background

![](/Images/biology/chromosomes.webp "Chromosomes")
{loading=eager}

Before any knowledge of this process or the molecular basis on genetics could be attained, the monk Gregor Mendel determined purely through experiments and statistics that traits were programmed by a number of genes, distinct units of heredity of which each organism had to carry two instances ([alleles]) - because peas, his model species, appear to be diploid, but some other plants aren't. And because he saw most traits (not all) to be inherited separately along during crosses, ignorant of the fate of the others, each gene was supposed to segregate *independently* as if being their own separate molecule. Then some phenotypical (visible) traits would be deemed monogenic if its transmission follow simple laws, thus depending on just one gene, or polygenic if pattens would appear in the segregation of phenotypes, which appeared to reflect that of several genes cooperation to produce an effect.

The laws are summarized in [Mendel's laws of inheritance](DFN)
- [Law of dominance and uniformity](DFN "Some alleles are dominant while others are recessive; an organism with at least one dominant allele will display the effect of the dominant allele.")
- [Law of segregation](DFN "During gamete formation, the alleles for each gene segregate from each other so that each gamete carries only one allele for each gene.")
- [Law of independent assortment](DFN "Genes of different traits can segregate independently during the formation of gametes.")

![](/Images/biology/Meiosis_Overview_new.svg)

We know now that it relates to the cellular process of gamete formation, the rearranging of DNA and packaging of the gene load in daughter cells. Our whole DNA, the vehicle for most of our heredity, is packaged in a set number of 46 pairs of chromosomes (for humans), independent molecules going in pairs of homologues sharing the same structure. During [meiosis], those homologous chromosomes physically bond, exchanging strands along the chromosome's length. Such crossing-overs happen at 7 places on average (over a varying length of DNA and distance from each others) and are responsible for a reshuffling of alleles, their redistribution, leading to the same sequence of genes along the molecules but a different combination of alleles between the two homologues.

Then the pair separates and migrate to opposite ends of the nucleus, forming two different gametes whose total DNA is the same as the original cell, but pairs broke up, so each cell keeps only one chromosome thusly one version of each gene. In humans a full [haplotype][haplotypes] complement (that of a gamete, spermatozoid or ovule) makes for 23 chromosomes, and fecundation restores the pairs. Genes on the same chromosome, the further they are from one another, the more likely a crossing-over is to take place, shuffling haplotypes of homologous chromosomes, with gametes being as likely to inherit recombinant molecules as if the pair of genes were on separate molecules. Inversely the closer physically, *linked*, the more likely a particular gene sequence or haplotype is to be passed on unchanged to daughter cells.

Of these three laws, only second has stood the test of time, aneuploidy (failures of chromosome pairs to segregate correctly) most often leading to catastrophic failures in development, whatever the organism. As we know now the physical underpinning of heredity the simplistic dichotomy dominant/recessive on the molecular level proved vastly inadequate, arising as an illusion du to the limitation of technical methods of the time of Mendel, until the mid-XIXth century.

Despite that in reality most mutations are completely silent, and that effects can arise at many levels, which might or not change the protein, its expression or regulation in any numbers of ways, which might or not impact the phentype. But of all genes, only a fraction produce proteins, while the overwhelming majority of mutant alleles. Early researchers suffered from selective perception (still now...), often rejecting unconclusive data they could not make sense of yet, in the name of dogmas born from those very limitations, prefering nice consistent (but ultimately false) theories to unclear facts.

Mendel only studying simple genetic systems, lead future generations to define genes as mostly protein-producing [loci] with mutations causing different colors sizes or aspects, or obvious failure. We've learnt since then that the expression of a lot of traits depend of complex pathways and the interactions with a quantity of other molecules, plus the effect of the environment. We know too that there is a (variable) number of steps from transcription to protein modification, with a multitude of interactions at all levels, so that dominance is only a relative notion if most of the time if we look closely, either lies on a scale, in some cases [numerical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_trait_locus "Quantitative Trait Locus - Wikipedia"). Similarly epistasy denotes the interdependance between genes in different chromosomes, whether collaborating in metabolic pathways or directly influencing each other's transcription and expression (cis and trans interactions are the same but when it happens respectively on the same chromosome, and when one gene influences itself but on the homologue chromosome).

There are but four evolutionary forces normally taught in school books, responsible for genetic changes: random mutation, survival of the fittest (death of the least adapted), genetic drift in particular in small population pockets, and migrations[^allow]. *But this had been so lacking as to close in on wrong.*

### The MHC and pathogen-driven selection

There exist [mechanisms](www.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2011.05367.x "Gene conversion rapidly generates major histocompatibility complex diversity in recently founded bird population (2001)") evidenced by a study on isolated bird populations whose origins are well established. This mechanism would appear to remediate for the low level of MHC diversity in genetically depauperate population, involving a reshuffling exons while maintening the exclusion from point blank SNPs thus preserving functionality.

Given that the process takes at minima a few tens of thousands of years (starting with less than a hundred strong founder population), most likely only in the few rare individuals, the frequency of the mechanism per site and generation must still be extremely rare... an order of magnitude higher than the expected chance mutation, while significant, is still very low. This could explain the difficulty to see this phenomena in laboratory or other controlled conditions, yet should be added to the three aforementioned classical mechanisms.

The difference being, that amped up gene conversions do not involve natural selection, *pathogene-mediated or otherwise*: While individuals with a renewed MHC repertoire could boast a survival advantage the latter is likely not significant, because the phenomena takes place in the span of millenia, not decades or centuries. Strenghtening _the absence of **experimental evidence** for natural selection_ against pathogens.

Explaining this incredible natural polymorphism demands quite a lot intellectual gymnastics, to explain how a supposed strong selection (which pathogens should cause) can coexist with an absence of selective sweeps (the eventual fixation of a beneficial mutation) and thus the maintenance of infrequent alleles, in less than 1% of the population.

The ruling opinion dictates that pathogens mutate constantly so that heterozygotes always have an advantage (heterozygote advantage), alleles never have the time to be discarded completely before recovering again some protective value (fluctuating selection) and rarity would hold an intrinsic edge for minor haplotypes as microbes would wouldn't statistically be compelled to adapt to unfrequent alleles, thus keeping the latter both relevant and rare.

It all sounds fine and dandy, but proving this model or the prevalence of any one of these mechanisms is impossible to attest or prove, both experimentally[^experimentally_impossible] and theoretically[^theoretically_impossible], thus it it is not a scientific theory but make-believe to maintain the myth of diversity, natural selection and the germ theory. And one should not conclude that cells would somehow keep a record in order to strike something like a "golden mean" in diversity, this gene conversion actually *erased* a number of haplotypes in *local* populations, their number only rising at the *metapopulation* level.
Several arguments in this case serve to discredit against the pathogen-driven selection being behind the usually high number of polymorphisms in the MHC.
- Firstly, the fact this increase here took 75 000 at minima, implies that the initial low paucity in MHC diversity in this bird population must not have prompted a strong selection pressure or caused significant mortality.
- Secondly, non-synonymous mutations did not exceed synonymous/neutral ones, a signature usually interpreted as *the absence of positive selection*. Yes hitchiking could explain that, however
- this phenomena only shuffled the *existing*, with no creation of new functional alleles, so that recombinant haplotypes could hardly constitute new effective defenses, which would quickly loose their edge anyway as supposedly pathogens never cease to evolve, and much faster than animals too.
- 75 000 years should be more than enough to overcome a very limited repertoire and we ought to see *balancing selection at play*, with diversity increasing both globally *and* locally.

What we see instead is a *very slow coalescing of an optimal number of semaphores with which to perfect the dialog with the local microbes and parasites*. I claim that the best fitting hypothesis for the genetic facts we observe in the MHC, are best explained by vertebrates sharing from time immemorial a symbiotic relationships with all microbes and all parasites, *commanding* them due to the exponential gap in complexity and adaptive capacity in our immune system.

The principle being, that it happens only as a consequence of pollution, or metabolic deficiency leading to waste accumulation and immune functions (meant to keep exogenetic cleaners honest) failing due to old age, signaling to predators and parasites alike which animals to single out, thus keeping populations in optimal health. Messed-up genetics from artificial or accidental [excessive inbreeding](https://doi.org/10.3390/cells8080783 "Genetic Association between Swine Leukocyte antigen Class II Haplotypes and Reproduction Traits in Microminipigs (2019)") may also be expected to lead to metabolic imbalance thus eliciting the appearance of pathogen-driven selection. Such models can not inform natural situations: these animals are not only very homozygous, but very degenerate too.

Assuming no human disturbance or cooking, no evidence of a genuinely adverse relationship has been seen with a natural microbe or parasite, in a natural situation, in Europe or Africa, on people or domestic animals, no any issue with local or exotic food as genetically remote and alien-looking as can be, pointing at the existence of an universal *molecular order* as old as life itself, explaning for instance how primate palates can enjoy and digest deep sea food, despite their ancestors possibly possibly not tasting them since the first batracian ventured on land.

So I supopse that in absence of environmental or *dietary* pollution **mortal** infections should not follow exposure to new "pathogens", when it comes to mammals, reptiles if not fish too. The concept of natural selection (in the strict sense of death and survival of the fittest) by pathogens in the case of higher vertebrates (and a small number of other animals), ultimately derives from the same pasteurian mindset as germ theory itself. We learnt to see only fighting and adversity, when nature has always been all about balance all along.
Maybe it is time we accept to revise our deep-seated presuppositions, and see this balance not just as an emergent property of complex ecological systems (species endangering their own long time survival weeding themselves out eventually) as modern ecology theorizes, but as a truly **primary** force ruling shaping genetics and molecular biology with undercurrents actually more fundamental than Darwinian dynamics.

[^theoretically_impossible]:
	```quote{cite="[How pathogens drive genetic diversity: MHC, mechanisms and misunderstandings (2010)](https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2009.2084)"}
	Pathogen-mediated selection (PMS) is believed to generate the extraordinary levels of MHC diversity observed. However, *establishing the relative importance of the three proposed mechanisms of PMS (heterozygote advantage, rare-allele advantage and fluctuating selection) has proved extremely difficult*.
	Here, we show that in many cases the same predictions arise from the different mechanisms under these approaches, and that most studies that have inferred one mechanism of selection have not fully considered the alternative explanations. We argue that, while it may be possible to demonstrate that particular mechanisms of PMS are occurring, *resolving their relative importance within a system is probably impossible*.

	```quote{cite="[Does reduced MHC diversity decrease viability of vertebrate populations? (2010)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2009.07.026)"}
	The evidence that the loss of MHC variation negatively affects population survival is so far equivocal and difficult to separate from effects of general inbreeding.
	```
	
### Quantal Genomics

Our DNA has been built over millions of years, forming adapted gene complexes whose unity is crucial to conserve adaptations through [epistasy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistasis "Epistasis - Wikipedia") for an optimal result in a given environment. But how could these sets be conserved, if at each meiosis everything is mixed up ?
It has been believed until now that statistics and linkage sufficed to account for this: proximity would ensure sufficient linkage and conservation of haplotypes, and [philopatry](incest#philopatry), breeding close to your birth place within your original stock (a fortiori your own family) will limit admixture and the splitting of coadapted complexes, while increasing statistically to reappear at each fecundation the closer your mate is to you.
Natural selection would have over time put genes functionally interdependent close to each other, maximizing their linkage, preserving their unity over generation. Population genetics teaches however that free recombination should prevent such packaging of [polymorphisms][polymorphism] (some considering this the most important feature of sex in the history of life !).

**Quantal genomics** explains how those genes can stay bundled, by actively maintainging this clustering and those [polymorphisms][polymorphism], on a much wider scale and frequency than entailed by distance only, by prohibiting recombination and mutations in a certain zone. [Ancestral Haplotypes](DFN) are specific sequences of up to 1 million base pairs in length conserved identical across **hundreds to thousands of generations**, counting sometimes in millions of years of age[^analysis_haplotype_sequences].

They represent alternative versions of **Polymorphic Frozen Blocks** ([PFB]s), continuous sets of genes in which mutations and recombinations (often less than 1% of recombinants within a population) are effectively suppressed. Multiple unrelated families display the same identical [AH]s, hinting at an extremely remote origin. These blocks often regulate genes expressed by cis (on the same chromosome) trans or epistatic interaction, as one super-gene. But not always, thence *natural selection alone* (nature killing recombinant mutants) *can not explain such conservation*[^recomb].

Linkage disequilibrium (non-independence of genes) when it occurs is simply a reflection of this conservation with some alleles relatively common in one haplotype compared to others. But each is ancestral. Only active preservation as an innate active cellular mechanism can account for this, a protection whose efficacy exceeds by several orders of magnitude (thousands of times) what we know of. *And it appears the vast majority of genes lie in such blocks.*

### Transmission Ratio Distortion

#### Meiotic drives

We know since 1950 that independent assortment - recombination being a pure product of unbiased statistics - is not absolute with the discover of [TRD](ABBR "Transmission Ratio Distortion") systems (or just *drives*), in some [haplotypes], in some conditions, happen to bend transmission into gametes heavily in their favor), or increasing its chances at fecondation.
Despite all the preventions against them, it is accepted that even very weak biases (around 1% of transmission of one chromosome against the other) are theoretically bound to have tremendous impact on the genetic structure of a species, as seen with flies, and it is believed that more complex drive systems will [eventually be discovered](https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-372568-4.00012-4 "Drive and sperm the evolution and genetics of male meiotic drive (2009)"), ultimately under the control of the nervous system.

Currently we only see those systems as detrimental, parasitic [selfish elements](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1007700 "Selfish genetic elements (2018)")). We consider them only harmful to the genome or species harboring them, cheating natural selection and accumulating genetic waste so strongly (owing to the frequent presence of inversions and the large impediment of recombination within those elements they incur) that a very strong **negative** selection value curtails the phenomena severly, despite logic stating they should quickly dominate in a population. But geneticists said the same about [transposons] and have been backpedalling for the last two decades perhaps, recognizing that transposons have always been an essential feature not a bug, of the evolutionary process.
Just as with viruses whose origin dates back to *the beginning of life itself* they share the mainstream acknowledged that organisms have learnt not only to only cope with [transposable elements][transposons] but to tame them into shape, into *omnipresent tools of the genetic machinery*.

#### Haploid selection

We have reason to believe the maternal body can intelligently, if the right conditions (of diet) are met, operate a sorting of the favourable and unfavourable sperm, to select the best available to meet the ovule.

![Diagram of mechanisms behind transmission ratio distorsion](/Images/biology/cellular_biology/resume_mecanisms_TRD.webp)
{cite="[Transmission ratio distortion: review of concept and implications for genetic association studies (2013)](www.doi.org/10.1007/s00439-012-1257-0)"}

![](/Images/biology/cellular_biology/Meiotic_Drive_illustration.webp "Illustration of meiotic drive")
{link="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tree.2016.02.001"}

Nature has found many ways to expediate the tedious and wasteful process of natural selection, by displacing the sorting onto the haploid phase (the sperm and ovules). Thanks to *gametic selection*, within one's own ejaculate[](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-66292-9_20 "Within-Ejaculate Sperm Selection and Its Implications for Assisted Reproduction Technologies (2021)")) as well as between the sperm of different males with skewed ratio over **97%** in favour of [one semen over another](www.doi.org/10.1093/molehr/gav012 "Do sperm possess a molecular passport? Mechanistic insights into sperm selection in the female reproductive tract ? (2015)").  

More than 99% of all gametes produced [before even fecundation](www.doi.org/10.1038/sj.cdd.4400396 "The role of the tumor suppressor p53 in spermatogenesis (1998)") are discarded during development, while during fecundation high stress on many levels (chemical, physical, energetic) ensures that from the typical 300 million sperm of an ejaculate, *only 5,000 sperm make it into the utero-tubal junction, 1,000 to the Fallopian tube, and [**just 200 actually reach the egg**](https://www.idahofertility.com/the-magic-that-happens-when-a-sperm-meets-an-egg-and-the-sparks-fly/ "The Magic That Happens When a Sperm Meets an Egg and the Sparks Fly"). And then, because ovas don't live long after maturation finished it is the usual case that sperm has to wait a few days in the Fallopian tubes before meeting the ovule.

But the fascinating part, is that *this quality control over gametes has shown to correspond to the quality of the offspring*: Thus nature can sort over millions of defective combinations of recombinant chromosomes without investing more than the resource of a single cell.

Experience with fish demonstrated that selecting for longevity would *retain only the most structurally sound sperm*[^single_ejaculate], and **this sperm granted a longer life and better health to its offspring**, with a small caveat:

Quality increased gametes until cellular decay overtakes irrespective of genetic quality, especialy for external fertilizers *in open water* due to lack of nourishment and [aggressive environment](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3949374/ "Sperm variation within a single ejaculate affects offspring development in Atlantic salmon (2014)"). In this context vitality is more expressed by a higher *motility*. Predictibly longevity should a bigger role in humans and other species with *internal fertilization*: within human females sperm doesn't last one minute such with some fishes, but up to [five days](https://doi.org/10.1023/a:1006527232605 "The probability of conception on different days of the cycle with respect to ovulation: an overview (1997)"), during which sperm are actively sustained by females.

Moreover, because surviving for days becomes a matter of luck too, in the context of [cryptic female choice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptic_female_choice "Cryptic female choice - Wikipedia") it is believed that the female environment can [**selectively** bind](https://doi.org/10.1530/rep-07-0333 "Chromatin-unstable boar spermatozoa have little chance of reaching oocytes in vivo (2018)") sperms it detects as genetically compatible, protecting it, [storing it, and discarding the rest](www.doi.org/10.1093/molehr/gav012 "Do sperm possess a molecular passport? Mechanistic insights into sperm selection in the female reproductive tract ? (2015)").

The intense dialog between embro/fÅtus points at the likely possibility for misscariages (embryonic lethality) to be induced by the mother, who in last analysis chooses to reject the conceptus(#reason. We do not know the content of the mother-fÅtus communication, but we do know it is constant and **extensive**, through exosome exchanges, especially in the early embryonic stages most concerned with [spontaneous abortions](https://www.doi.org/10.3892/etm.2022.11518 "Exosomes and exosomal nonâcoding RNAs throughout human gestation (2022)").

It also makes little doubt that such incredibly complex processes can only work well in **healthy** individuals, thus optimally only in organisms purified by years of instinctonutrition. Since we know the brain can mess up dramatically hard under the common lifestyle, it stands to reason that anything involving a high degree of bodily intelligence must have been a lot more efficient in the past in absence of molecular pollution.

Miscarriages or spontaneous abortions are a natural cleansing function more elaborated than usually assume. The mother's body involves itself to weed out the unfit, replacing advantageous selection by predators while sparring the mother the need for the costly expenditure of resource that is pregnancy. At the very least, [Conceptuses](DFN "Embryo in the uterus, especially during the early stages of pregnancy") bearing homozygote recessive genes either fail, self-terminate, or are called for termination by the mother.

All those phenomena make natural conception and births a mystery we will never replace or explain entirely. Trying to circumvent nature as the whole business of assisted reproduction is about, is utter degenerative folly.

### Lamarckism

#### Soma-to-germaline connection

The *Central Dogma* of molecular biology states that biological systems can not modify their own heredity **purposely**, the information (including the body itself) cannot flow back to its source. Because it is lost, the converse must also hold true: it ensues that change to the germline could never originate from the environment nor the body can cause mutations. This belief took hold in 1958, with Francis Crick. It entailed that change to the germline must occur *randomly*.

Even mainstream science now acknowledges the fluidity of DNA and its considerable sensitivity to environmental variations. Experiments gradually undermined Weismann's tale especially with the likes of Ted J. Steele, uncovering the molecular basis of the mechanisms for the heredity of acquired traits, revealing an information structure or **plan** deep within the DNA molecule itself. And a plan implies an intelligence... that of the brain or higher forces, no real difference as far as we should concern ourselves.

We are led to conclude that most mutations longer than [SNP]s, are likely to proceed from innate mechanisms. This would change all conclusions regards to the mechanism of evolution[](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2019.08.010 "Lamarck and Panspermia - On the Efficient Spread of Living Systems Throughout the Cosmos, Steele et al. (2019)"). The notion of molecular clock at the core of genetic datation, based on the assumption that most would be rendered null[^evidence-for-Larmarck], as to function as a clock, the rate of mutation must be constant and thus, most mutations neutral, to escape selection. If they become adaptive, then thos assumptions can not hold, explaining the varying rates that are indeed observed.

The most conclusive evidence is the paper by Cossetti et al demonstrating the transport of massive amount of injected RNA into spermatozoa, strongly suggesting that [exosomes](viral_phenomenon#exosomes) are the *carriers of a flow of information from somatic cells to gametes*[^cossetti].
	
![Image Cosetti article dna transfer cells to sperm](/Images/biology/cellular_biology/cossetti_transfert_arn_somatic_cells_to_sperm.webp)

The reason was that hereditary information was before supposed immortal, fixed, and thus protected from any tempering by the environment by a purely hypothetical barrier around the gonads as the Weismann barrier, akin to the blood-brain barrier.
This belief became dogma in total absence of any evidence. However one chooses to dissect this strange, aberrant cultural shift, as a result our understanding of heredity and biology in general suffered a massive sterilization, and a dearth of researchers for the *debunked* Lamarckian perspective. Yet a sum of inconvenient data piled up... and **faced silence**.

The first (and rather immediate) dent into this dogma was **epigenetics**.
Taking only the narrow definition, it refers to potentially hereditary adaptations or changes which do not involve the DNA sequence but instead reversible chemical modifications on it (for humans mostly cytidine methylation).

![Explanation epigenetics](/Images/biology/explanation_epigenetics.webp)
 
Such modifications can to the offspring either through RNA molecules distributed in a stochastic (random) non-mandelian manner, with no fixed transmission ratio as they multiply or not in various body parts and influence early development.
Studies showed that our lives - metabolic stress of all kinds (drugs, tobacco, starvation, **diet**), emotional traumas also - do leave clear methylation profiles on our DNA, regulating genetic expression through a whole range of specialized enzymes readers and writers, probably to better cope with a repeating situation and giving a head start to one's descendants.

![Integrated lamarckian inheritance schema](/Images/biology/cellular_biology/integrated_lamarckian_inheritance_schema.webp)
{.center}

We commonly suspect an epigenetic origin in features with certain heritability but imperfect penetration and above all not respecting Mendelian segregation from one generation to the other.

Epigenetics has been all the rage since the 2000s, and much effort has been devoted, demonstration the complexity of a body bursting with somehow conflicting yet harmonious regulatory pathways operating at varying scales, deeply interdependent... And those fine transient chemical tunings can remain stable over **dozens of generations in animals**.
However, after a time methylated cytosines do tend to mutate, making the attemptive adaptation definitive, breaching the gap between accepted soft epigenetics and **neo-lamarckism**. Science had greatly underestimated the intelligence of the living, and its beauty. Studies and experiments showed how our body both represses and stimulates mutations, in a directed, designful manner.

Direct exchanges of brain genetic material to sperm (ovules too, certainly) have been observed, and gametes themselves are especially sensitive to any surrounding material, featuring an important retro transcriptional activity. Your seed spontaneously really absorbs part of the experiences you collect throughout your life, as in the Dune novels, though obviously there is not nearly enough place in DNA for entire memories... although the novels themselves (*Chapterhouse*) alluded to genetic memories taking place in another dimension, just like [we think](spirituality#the-nature-of-memories).

#### Somatic HyperMutation

But the most critical rebuking of the Central Dogma (as well of the notion of chaotic mutations) took place in the early 1990s when the phenomenon of somatic hypermutation was discovered, in which immune system cells (lymphocytes B), to produce an exponential variety of antibodies out of proportion to the smallness of the genetic repertoire inherited from the parents (the V repertoire) routinely undergo localized and controlled rounds of mutations[](https://www.scientificexploration.org/edgescience/8 "Lindley et al, How Evolution Occurs: Was Lamarck Also Right. EdgeScience, 8, 6-9 (2011)")[](https://dx.doi.org/10.5772/61794 "Analysis of Haplotype Sequences, Sally S. Lloyd, Edward J. Steele and Roger L. Dawkins (2015)"), as well as implications and evidences for the immune system[](https://europepmc.org/article/MED/25810320 "Soma-to-germline feedback is implied by the extreme polymorphism at IGHV relative to MHC: The manifest polymorphism of the MHC appears greatly exceeded at Immunoglobulin loci, suggesting antigen-selected somatic V mutants penetrate Weismann's Barrier (2015)")[](https://doi.org/10.1111/sji.12670 "Germline V repertoires: Origin, maintenance, diversification, Steele, E. J., & Lindley, R. A. (2018)"). Steele thought in the context of immunology and fighting against pathogens so he immediately assimilated

Steele has shown that the new combinations produced were sometimes returned to the germ lines to be inherited. It was not taken well by the scientific community, retorting that however we always catch polio, flu etc. But with principles of instinctonutrition the contradiction disappears. The body does not adapt to *fight* viruses, but on the contrary to get sick more efficiently and use these *pathogens* in the context of endogenous processes of elimination of denatured molecules, mostly cooking-originating molecules nowadays. The error is simply to project the parasitic-hote model on the virus instead of blaming the environment, meaning the lifestyle.

The variations known as Single Nucleotide [Polymorphisms][polymorphism] which are the bulk of genetic variation world-wide, show for lots of them if not most, a mutational signature typical of deaminase activity, the main means of DNA/RNA edition at our disposal. That means *a significant part of all changes considered so far as random (usually hazardous) could be  adaptive innovations*, either through the the aforementioned very slow, unreliable change of methylated cytosines, or the fast potent way featured by the somatic hypermutation:

Genes transcribed into RNA get holes punched into them with deaminases, holes then filled with faulty polymerases, then the result is retrotranscribed into DNA like viruses do, to replace the old version, with the new mutations. Data suggest, that the **totality of the genome** functional genes RNAs pseudogenes and repeated sequences alike have at some point or another, been subjected to hypermutation.

Incidentally, we have known for a long time embryos and gametes, though in theory the most guarded against retrotransposition/integration of foreign genetic material, actually demonstrates the opposite: Mature spermatozoa and early embryos are extremly permeable to foreign DNA and RNA molecules, by design.

```quote{cite="Soma to germline inheritance of extrachromosomal genetic information via a LINE-1 reverse transcriptase-based mechanism" author="Corrado Spadafora"}
Retrotransposon-encoded RT is stored in mature gametes, is highly expressed in early embryos and undifferentiated cells, and becomes downregulated in differentiated cells. In turn, RT plays a role in developmental control, as its inhibition arrests developmental progression of early embryos with globally altered transcriptomic profiles. Thus, sperm cells act as recipients, and transgenerational vectors of somatically derived genetic information which they pass to the next generation with the potential to modify the fate of the developing embryos.
```

These mutations would thus affect **all organs**, the muscles, ears, eyes. Not unlike what Frank Herbert described. In this conception of evolution currently work-in-progress, selection still does matter, but its role is limited to sorting out endogenous ordered adaptations, putting to test the product of lives and intelligences.

Evolution of this type gives a satisfactory explanation to the enormous complexity of behavioral instincts: Such traits would be lost by mixing with other groups bearing adaptations of their own to wholly different selective pressures, born of different ecologies, social environment and pre-existing racial background. Mating within your family which in all likelihood experienced the same things under the same cognitive constraints, leads also in all likelihood to the same solutions, because your genetics are therefore compatible, essentially doubling down on your adaptation. Thus justifying the ancient practice of hereditary monarchies and noble marriages.

On the theoretical level, the need for a great heterozygosity (both alleles of a pair of chromosomes differing), the greatest genetic variety in order to stay adaptable to a changing environment does not hold up. It is false that a consanguineous species would become uniformly homozygous and vulnerable to environmental changes: These two assumptions are false. In addition, **adaptation to a changing environment is not necessarily based on a heterozygous population**[^shield_266].
{#homeostasis}

But exampls of immediate Lamarck transmissions of relatively complex adaptations of the most impressive kind do exist however[^exist], proving the potency of mating relatives who shared the same experience at play. One should absolutely replicate these experience, and evaluating statistically the strength of the protection shared depending on the level of consanguinity of matings.

### Fetal eugenics

#### Directed miscarriages {#testing-fetuses}

We have strong reasons to believe that an organism practicing instinctotherapy will eliminate a greater proportion of defective embryos by inducing their premature death specifically. They are also common with consanguineous matings, though populations inbred for long enough can be expected, as happened in Qatar[^B], to not show such static link between miscarriages and parental relatedness, thanks to genetic purge for eliminating recessive genes with time.

We theorize an *active selection of viable fetuses in the context of consanguinity*, with an emphasis on shared alleles in the extended HLA haplotype. Matching for HLA-B, C and C4 alleles in particular[^selection].

One one hand, we might assume an immune reaction of the mother's body, attacking the fetus. This is  a common problem even today when the child happens to bear a different rhesus factor than the mother, leading to [rejection in utero](DFN "The antibodies of a mother sensitized to the Rh factor can cross the placenta and infiltrate the blood of the fetus. These antibodies destroy some of the baby's red blood cells and cause fetal anemia, or Rh disease, in which red blood cells are destroyed faster than the body can replace them."). However, this doesn't exist with animals, and only happens in a **cooked food setting**. Mr Burger's wife (Nicole Burger) has had this problem, then she ate a ton of chanterelle which *completely changed her own rhesus factor blood ratio*, and the baby suffered no issue. Something similar could happen in some cases, which would reflect our unnatural diet and not the simple facts of genetics.

The second hypothesis, is that this compatibility would be determined at least in part by the affinities in the major histocompatibility complexes, resulting in a closer and active *sensitivity to the child's genetic defects*, with a greater amount of miscarriages than the normal couples, while in theory, at least in the long run, the **surviving children** would achieve **better health**.

The study shows that the effect is correlated with the global matching of MHC I and II, therefore correlated with the *intensity of inbreeding*, exposing more recessive defects, explaining a higher initial fetal loss. *We suppose a joint evolution of the fetus and the mother to favor the best DNA in the interest of the species*, is both more logical and congruent with the literature.

Moreover a defective individual with reduced reproductive potential (or very shortened lifespan) will be able to multiply more of his DNA through his siblings and healthy parents than himself, in the same way that in eusocial insects (ants, bees, termites...) workers or non-reproductive castes work for the reproduction of the queen, insofar as her offspring are extremely close genetically (or even clones) of the workers. Thus this higher *inclusive fitness*---multiplying one's share of DNA in circulation---, in accordance with the egoist gene theory, could very well explain in evolutionary terms the participation of the fetus to this active screening at the price of its own survival.

So it would not be surprising if we had evolved at the fetal stage the tendency to sacrifice ourselves in case of even minor genetic defects, rather than aggressively clinging to the slightest resource of the mother's body as is claimed today, in pure projection of liberal capitalism on nature. Communist biologists would probably have come to different conclusions.

#### The power of Consanguinity

One finding might suggest a **unique capacity for inbred mammals to either epigenetically compensate for recessives, or even repair their DNA**, depending on the nature of the prior symptoms.

A family of triple homogenous [knock-out](DFN "A mutation permanently preventing the expression of the gene, by stopping the synthesis of a key protein.") mutants (Cyp1a1âCyp1a2âCyp1b1<sup>â/â</sup>) was developped, of which and only two females and one male lived to adulthood and were able to breed successfully. Members of the Cyp1 to Cyp4 gene families, are generally thought of as liver enzymes that metabolize drugs and environmental chemicals, most if not all ubiquitous in all cells of the body, involved among other things in the synthesis and/or degradation of eicosanoids.
The first generation all showed dire symptoms consistent with eicosanoid-mediated processes, so that out of the *only 2 females and one males only out of 58 specimen lived to adulthood*. But then **the symptoms disappeared** and the animals went back **to full health in 2 to 4 generations*, leading the researcher to label the phenomenon "inbreeding de-repression".

The speed of its effect (2 to 4 generations) led them to the conclusion that the symptoms in the first place were not genetic in the first place. But that does not make sense, because as said [previously](incest#inbreeding) lab mice routinely tolerate an unlimited amount of inbreeding, to the point of being complete clones of one another, without any noticeable health issue. So the symptoms of the first generation of complete knock-out mice could not be caused by inbreeding per se, but by the unfunctional genes: the symptoms had to be genetic, not epigenetic.

So there are only two explanations left:
1. Because the mouse genomes includes 102 protein-coding cytochrome P450 (CYP) genes and the knocking-out only concerned 3 of these genes, it is not impossible that inbreeding triggered a epigenetic compensating mechanism sur-expressing the other proteins of the family so as to take up the extra work. Enzymes sometimes have extreme substrate specificity, sometimes on the contrary a wide range.
2. The CYP family includes 88 [pseudogenes](DFN "A pseudogene is a segment of DNA that structurally resembles a gene but is not capable of coding for a protein. Pseudogenes are most often derived from genes that have lost their protein-coding ability due to accumulated mutations that have occurred over the course of evolution."), and non-translated pseudogenes have been found to preserve functionality by exerting a regulatory effect on their active cousins by [producing non-coding RNA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3078729/ "Pseudogenes: Pseudo-functional or key regulators in health and disease? (2011)"), which makes all the more sense if they are products of lamarckian evolution through retrotranscription. In certain conditions---cancers---they can also produce **truncated** proteins.
3. The third possibility is for the faulty genes themselves to have undergone repairs by an innate recovery mechanism.

While the first option is possible, interesting and certainly true to some extent, there are few reasons that it can account for a complete reversion to health. Evolution would favor such a process, given that the genetic defects would still be present, leading a [mutation runaway](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31778175/ "Mutations Beget More Mutations-Rapid Evolution of Mutation Rate in Response to the Risk of Runaway Accumulation (2020)"), making the emergence of such coping mechanism highly unlikely.

The authors arrive to the conclusion that inbreeding's effects in general might be more epigenetic than genetic, explaining the seemingly quickly and complete reversion, but the symptoms were clearly not due to inbreeding. and a redundance of functions such that 4 knock-out genes of the family would in effect superfluous, yet initially wreaks so much havock, is hard to believe and even harder to justify evolutionarily.

On the other hand, in the framework of ordinary neo-Darwinism, a reversion even of a single gene such option 2 and 3 imply, would involve a random yet impossibly precise [back mutation](DFN "Reverse mutation from the aberrant state of a gene back to its normal, or wild type, state can result in a number of possible molecular changes at the protein level.") in that particular gene *without the help of the classic homologous recombination/convertion*. The probability is astronomically low, in fact impossibly low when concerning 3 genes, **progressively** over several generations.

But knowing how what original mutation(s) led to the knock-out lines could make a big difference, making such reversion much more likely: Because the term "knock-out" signifies that protein *synthesis* is averted, only regulatory regions and/or the initiation codon really need be affected, not the sequence coding for important aminoacids such as those responsible for the folding of the protein, or its catalytic site. And within the same gene family initiation sequences are either not unique, or tolerant to some level of changes.

Consequently, the information destroyed by the mutation could conceivably be recovered from the template of other genes through retrotranscription, *the same process at the origin of most gene families*, thus restoring gene functions. Unfortunately later generations of mice were **not** sequenced: only finding out the status of the knock-out genes could confirm our hypothesis.

Such reparation through *exon shuffling* or *non-homologous recombination* can happen because of sequence similarity, naturally **enhanced with inbreeding**.

## Eugenic plan {#eugenic_plan}

### Statement of purpose

Eugenics of the past, German or otherwise, systematically failed to accomplish anything, because they lacked:
1. The financial resource
2. A wide access to the population and the ability to order around matings as a State resource, regardless of Christian or liberal morality.
3. Any true scientific understanding of heredity whatsoever
4. **time**.

While classical breeding methods proved efficient enough with animal husbandry for centuries, the time they take is not one human beings have the luxury of spending. People live longer lives than rats and cows, fortunately or unfortunately depending on who we consider. So what works to create pure races in animals from a select few individuals, while already taking its fair share of time, would take *centuries* in humans, or rather millennia taking into account millions of people, and for an inferior result disregarding molecular flaws. That is why we imperatively need the help of genetic engineering in the long run.

In order to bring back the [evolutive perfection we lost](ADD_REF) with cooking about 40 000 years ago, a multi-layered, comprehensive plan has taken form:
1. Because we [established](neandertals) that all flaws, hidden or physically obvious, simple (recessive lethals) or subtle (misadaptations, admixture) ultimately derive from cooking, as the most important source of chaotic mutations.
Thus there can be no hope nor use in improving the race without stopping immediately the onslaught of denatured molecules and mutations that are increasing with each passing decade.
1. The second step will be to select the purest European Nordic stocks, with stringent a selection regards to health, molecular and [phenotypical](DFN "Relating to the physical characteristics of something living, especially those characteristics that can be seen")) traits acknowledged as statistically European in origin. *Then those will be heavily inbred*, to put to use the genetic purge that systematic consanguinity provides[](incest#natural-eugenics)[](ADD_REF "add link to part of the same article pointing to further materials about inbreeding), the efficiency of with is like to be magnified by recovering [the wildest and most original diet](instincto), identical in quality to that of great apes.
1. Concurrently, *through extensive experiments and analyses on elite genetics*, to discover and categorize all the alleles and haplotypes proving either dysfunctional, dating to after the start of cooking and civilization either through mutations or foreign admixture.
*Then they will be removed from the gene pool, through further breeding schemes and ultimately a genetic engineering of a novel kind*.

These efforts will enable the complete purification of our race, gathering and concentrating all the ancestral traits still existing today, eradicate all health issues of any kind as Hitler wished for[^putative]. Given a few centuries or a millenia of absolute dedication with the resource of a State, they will bring forth human beings with physical and mental powers only the wildest imagination can approach, along with a few hundred years of lifespan over the 1000 that we lost. 
Then finally (and concurrently) we shall rely on Lamarckian mechanisms to finally resurrect all the abilities that had been our birthright, *through the harshest training and hardening of our lifestyle* which shall seep into our genes with each passing generation.

Adoption will be generalized and seen as a noble sacrifice or not a sacrifice at all, given than love a child is so much more important [in all conceivable levels](meta), than begetting them.

### Breeding criteria

The first eugenic imperative should always remain to preserve our *original racial scheme* by excluding all admixtures from breeding, because this can never be corrected by any level of dilution: the future race will descend only from the purest Nordic people, or will not be. As a reward, impure Europeans and other foreign racial elements will enjoy all the rights and privileges of life in the new Europe, if they embrace sterilization[^impure_europeans]. Therefore the most important criteria for selection, must be the persistence of the most sriking European recessive traits of eye color, skin color and skull shape.

But also objectively, universally adaptive traits like *reaction time or nerve transmission speed* will provide good proxys for intelligence *as it is measure objectively.*
School results are an indicator only as many tests and educational opportunities are standardized, which imply control for parental influences (and reform the entirety of the school system !) so that everyone gets the same training. They cannot be genuine indices of hereditary value before the educative conditions have been optimized and normalized in the whole (breeding) population otherwise one cannot tell apart nurture from nature. Discaring IQ tests completely would be preferable as they are rather mechanical, hardly involving any efforts, unlike actual school work. This is shown by psychological studies. Yet it's about the most trustworthy indicator in all of psychology, so they shall keep their use. 

Hence no effort should be spared, to develop the sciences of psychometry and neurology to an extreme degree: the scientific, objective measurement of acultural and mostly physical traits indicative of intelligence, brain efficiency or development. *They are necessary by any multi-centuries breeding effort, in order to assess progresses with objectivity and security*.

### Inbreeding

Beside de novo chromosomal anomalies such as trisomies which always result either in stillbirths, early death or sterility (hence canât propagate), the grossest genetic flaws consist in recessive alleles who presence in the heterozygotic state (one allele flawed over two) does not cause death or a major trouble. It has been  established that more than 70 % of the genetic load is made up of these alleles.  When an allele is fixated â meaning all chromosomes in an entire population include it â there is no possible selection or improvement â save for new mutations to arise â as there is no possible variation between individuals, over which to select.

To select the healthy from the flawed, there needs to be a difference between the two ! Hence, to remove defects, one needs to either isolate them by amplifying their detriment in the homozygous state (then weeding out those bloodlines), or generate variation by concentrating their overall proportion (in the whole genome) in a select number of lines.

In fact, both endeavours cross and find achievement through [consanguinity](incest). Among the same average genepool mating close kin has the automatic effect of heightening variance, depending on the existing allelic diversity. According to fossil Neanderthal DNA our ancestors were a fairly consanguineous bunch, with a fairly high degree of homozygosity or individual uniformity on a chromosomal level, hence while a few heterozygous recessives do not necessarily constitute defects (the resulting trait could be advantageousâ¦ theoretically!) our species is not meant to carry a lot of them and most likely not to profit from them either: within a natural mating framework, with the small effective population number that was ours, they could not remain heterozygous for long.

So with consanguinity degenerate bloodlines die out (mostly in embryo, or through predation, natural or artificial selection) whereas other survive and become much healthier, purged from the genetic load, minus some loss of diversity and Â« bad Â» but not lethal alleles which got fixated.

![Meme about centuries of incest among Pharaohs](/Images/memes/meme_pharaos_centuries_of_incest.webp)

Hence once those purified bloodlines have been obtained, it is advantageous to mix them with each others, to increase variance and diversity again, and remove those other bad alleles as well, as each consanguineous line is susceptible to fixate by chance (or genetic drift) a different set of unwanted traits, not present in others.
Three factors determines the efficiency of this protocol:
- The more related parents are the faster recessives show themselves
- the more offspring such matings produce the more available combinations you produce out of the parentsâ genome, out of which a harsher selection can apply to find the ones completely devoid of lethals, hence the healthiest children and so also the least susceptible to fix non-lethals detrimental alleles
- the more diversity population-wise and more bloodlines subjected to this purification, the further the operation can be carried out and repeated by crossing those lines to concentrate good haplotypes and remove the bad ones through selective breeding.

It entails that the ultimate unmasking of alleles would be selfing, as a (very) low number of animals (mostly invertebrates) though a fair proportion of plants do. **Selfing is different from cloning.** [Cloning](DFN) consists in the perfect preservation of the parental (maternal) sequence without formation of gametes and recombinations, but that is very rare in vertebrates, and technically difficult to induce as the formation of the first polar body (which sees homologous chromosomes separating) happens very early, and can not be averted. Cloning will require a costly and wasteful lab procedure as long as synthesizing both DNA and gametes is not an option.
Beside we desire not perfect copies *but the improvement of traits*, which requires the recombination of existing alleles.

__________

The haploid complement of the second polar body is not exactly identical, since on average one sister chromatid has undergone crossing-overs prior (while the other not), so reuniting them produce (on average) 50% homozygous pairs, not 100%, while the first generation maintains 75% of the maternal information. Also allelic recombination (hence the heterozygous state) is more frequent for some chromosomes than others, and the closer to the centromere. o compare, the offspring of normal sibling (or parent-child) incest is 25% homozygote. Fusing the blastomere on the other hand, guarantees total 100% homozygotes or *double haploids*.

[Selfing](DFN) on the other hand implies the production of gametes of both sexes within oneself, followed by fertilization. Any one chromosome pair can recombine or not be recombined while in the aforementioned model, one is always recombinant and the other not.

Hence selfing produces more varieties to pick from. This, would be the ultimate form of natural incest. One impossible to emulate per se since we cannot produce both gamete types, we are not hermaphrodite snails.


_________

Producing ovules out of a man yet (or sperm out of a female, though that would be much easier) is out of the question and with the current craze about transsexuals I hope will stay that way, but inducing gynogenesis (a synonymous of parthenogenesis) is possible through two kinds of chromosomal manipulation, which precipitates in respectively 3-4 generations or just one the genetic result of 12 generations of sibling matings. Gynogenesis is a common feature of reptiles, amphibians and fish, mostly associated with external fertilization.

gynogenesis
:	```quote{cite="1997, Induction of mitotic and meiotic gynogenesis and production of genetic clones in rohu, Labeo rohita Ham"}
	Gynogenesis is useful for rapid improvement of genetic characters, producing inbred (clonal) lines compared with the traditional methods of sib-mating for up to 10 to 20 generations. Clonal lines are supposed to be very valuable products for improvement of fish stocks. In view of this, meiotic gynogenesis have been produced in many species of fish but are not completely homozygous due to recombination between non-sister chromatids. This occurrence is undoubtedly absent in case of the production of mitotic gynogenotes induced by the suppression of first mitotic cleavage and thereby the progeny are homozygous at every gene locus. Therefore, it is very advantageous for producing clonal lines in the subsequent generation(s) with unique gene combination.
	```

Since the species of interest always require a fake fecundation (without syngamy) to initiate development, gynogenesis always requires sperm sterilized through UV rays. Suppressing the ejection of the second polar body is done through either/or osmotic shock (temporary pressurization) or heat shock.

Non-mammalian vertebrates can often be treated like this easily and may do so naturally on a regular basis owning to the frequency of external fertilization, as the very aggressive exterior environment easily provides the shock required to suppress the ejection of the second polar body, which only happens at the very end of fecundation. Inferior vertebrates (not counting birds) also feature more often polyploidy or underwent recently several rounds of entire genome duplication, making their genetics extremely labile, a property also explaining their ease of hybridization.
On the other hand, mammals are notably more complicated with all of the above both rare and highly detrimental. Even sharing fragments of chromosomes has the same effect, because of [parental imprinting](DFN), involving critical chemical markings to control which complement of chromosome is expressed during development, depending on their origin. That said, we may soon [overcome this barrier](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2115248119 "Viable offspring derived  from single unfertilized mammalian oocytes (2022)").

One must wonder though: in practice, assuming total access to the purest Nordic sample, how many defects would we observe in humans with such a drastic method ? Hard to gauge. While normal incest with sound parents is usually very safe, these protocols we discuss entail from twice to four times the amount of consanguinity of sibling incest in one go, making dead certain to reveal whatever might be hiding in the recesses of your genome. Fish species throughout evolution went through several rounds of entire genome duplications, and some species - like trouts - more recently than others, producing highly redundant gene families, acting in effect as multiple extra alleles, hence in these cases the resilience to higher degrees of homozygosity than customary for us.

Even then, fishes respond in a variety of way:
```quote
Consequently, to obtain the sufficient DH genetic materials without reducing reproductivity for many fish species is still an important challenge. In this study, all six gynogenetic fish were successfully induced to produce DH offspring, whereas only one common fish did. In addition, both the CHR and the CNR of the common fish were lower than those of the gynogenetic fish. Induction rates of DH increased with Parental fish homozygosity rising, and a very significant correlation was found. Meiotic gynogenesis could provide an effective means to rapidly obtain homozygotes in fish. As indicated earlier, meiotic gynogenesis is easier to conduct than mitotic gynogenesis.
The mean survival rate of offspring produced by mitotic gynogenesis was very poor (4.1%) when compared to meiotic gynogenesis (19.3%) in loach (Arai 2001). Goudie, Simco, Davis and Liu (1995) tried meiotic and mitotic gynogenesis in channel catfish. They documented survival rates at 1.5 months of 2% for meiotic and 0.2% for mitotic gynogenesis. We observed a similar result: the CNRs of C1 and G3 for mitotic gynogenesis were 10.34% and 20.40%, respectively, compared to 48.42% and 57.25% for meiotic gynogenesis.[â¦](#)

In this study, CHR increased from 0% to 20.00% in outbred females **to 21.74% to 44.59% in the first generation** of meiotic gynogenesis. This phenomenon could be due to a decrease in the number of recessive lethal alleles (Nagy, Rajki, Horvath & Csanyi 1978), because deleterious genes should be eliminated from proximal regions of chromosomes by consecutive meiotic gynogenesis. Therefore, this may be a feasible method to obtain DH genetic materials for flounder.
```
This shows the efficacy of the method. The more inbred the stock, the more intense inbreeding it can tolerate without failure, purging bloodlines even faster. The [wild brown trout](https://doi.org/10.1155/2017/2975187 "The wild Salmo trutta m. fario (the brown trout (2017)"), a diploid species like us") show a survival rate up to the hatching stage though, was hatching stage 42.1 Â± 3.17 %, against 91.9 Â± 1.30 % for normal heterozygous brow truta fishes.

![brown_trout](/Images/biology/brown-trout2.webp)

The probability of two alleles to be identical by descent for brother/sister matings is [25%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inbreeding "Inbreeding - Wikipedia"). [We established](incest) that the actual risk for first generation incest offspring of unhealthiness (not even proper birth defects) in a subpopulation with no obvious hereditary issues (though no thorough tests have been made) is no higher than [12.4%](incest#real_risk) and if we exclude troubles most likely of [dietary origin](instincto), than 6.2%.
Extrapolating for a 100% chance of identity by descent (basically what they did with fish) would give hypothetically a maximum of 12.4â(100/6,25) = 49.6% risk assuming all diseases are congenital and genetic, and a minimum of 24.8%, figures framing those of the fish experiments.
Although we have to keep in mind that fish in general and the brown trout in particular differ from us in many ways, with both higher mutation rates but also higher survivability due to a genome [more robust and redundant](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8488904/ "The genome sequence of the brown trout, Salmo trutta Linnaeus (2021)") than ours due to successive rounds of [genome duplication over the eons](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms4657 "The rainbow trout genome provides novel insights into evolution after whole-genome duplication in vertebrates (2014)"), so direct analogy provides only a rough estimation. But on the other hand extrapolated probabilities for inbreeding morbidity in humans have proven wrong.

But most of all their offspring's heterozygosity would halve immediately, and again each generation. Compared to usual breeding practices the time saved would be tremendous, considering that one human generation canonically takes 20 years and fish take **6 months or less**. With such couples one could dial the speed up to eleven.

Not only would this expedite any and all genetic purification endeavour, this would also provide essentially the level of Genetic Sexual Attraction and psychic link true twins possess, but on the heteresexual mode. Producing a female from a male is easier, but then produces an identity of the two X, which despite lyonization or X-inactivation would still produce some issues due to recessive lethals (the inactivation is not total).

There is one reason it has never been seen except in lab mice clonal lines, taking at least ten generations to make: parental epigenetic imprinting. This is a system where DNA is loaded with transient chemical marks altering the expression of genes, and are recognized as Self, so that fecundations or later fetal development is automatically aborted for a single pair of chromosomes inherited from the same parent as a bloc, whether it be a duplicate chromosome or the two homologs. Even for a short piece of a chromosome. *This should be feasable in less than 50 years*.

### Genetic modification

The most fundamental issue with genetic modification in and of itself, *lies in our incapacity to predict the consequences of our modifications*. We suggest to abandon *designer sequence*, which cut in pieces our God-give gene plan with unkonwn repercussion. Instead, we shall let *the tried and true natural selection pit the clean natural haplotypes against their flawed versions, incapable to sustain life under homozygous expression* as revealed through the many proposed methods some theoretical (artificial selfing), some common and starting to work on mammals after decades of failure. Then more artificial methods (in vivo through implants for instance and/or widespread retroviruses, or in vitro) could inhibit or reject the gametes featuring defectuous haplotypes, stacking the odds considerably towards increasingly better offspring.

Our case however would chiefly qualify as *knock-in* procedures that substitute a sequence provided from the outside to an existing one. Changing an allele or haplotype for a designer one. But efficient manipulations on a large scale (hundreds of genes) would require perfect reading, digitization and synthesis of millions of base pair, follow by their integration into a cell without side effects. And sadly enough, none of this is possible yet, not even the reading part.

To enable modifications at the nucleotide (single base pair) level, we employ sets of enzymes basically acting as scissors, cutting then pasting or calling the cell's gluer. The issue with this technology (CRISPR-Cas9 among some others) is its unavoidable imprecision: the cutting place is hardly controlled and the pasting no more, while multiple instances of the gene often integrate the genome. This doesn't bother plants or bacteria, and fish DNA (for purpose of commercila exploitation), being so polyploid, can take a lot of punishment, but it is another story altogether for mammals. Yet we do not mind a lot of waste in order to get a viable product in industrial husbandry though, and it easy to overlook the whole lot of detrimental health effects on animals fed processed food regardless: they are already closer to machines than living being.

![Horrible picture of industrial ducklings](/Images/images_article_instincto/chicks-are-pictured-in340-million-.webp)

But such awful results are unimaginable on humans, and edition on human germlines are banned internationally, rightfully so. On the other hand, the very first method we used for genetic edition (beside dumb blind irradiation) to use constrasts a lot, and called homologous recombination. The idea was simply to inject and propose an alternative DNA strand, with which the cell will substitute to the one it already has, based on their overall similarity and/or a prior double-strand breaking of two boundary-limiting motifs.
This way has the advantage of inserting only once the modification, and more precisely as well. Artificial scissors are an external aggression on a complicated machinery that evolved for tens of millions of years, one we will never master.

> One approach to gene therapy is to replace defective genes with wild-type functional genes at a targeted site in the genome. This approach has the advantage of ensuring gene expression at endogenous levels under the physiological control of normal gene regulatory elements.

Homologous recombination and gene conversion are in vivo highly directed and controlled, animal cells have been capable of autonomous complex genetic edition as part of Lamarckian processes[](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00251-021-01234-5 "Haplotype structures and polymorphisms of dog leukocyte antigen (DLA) class I loci shaped by intralocus and interlocus recombination events (2022)") forever. Despite the prevalent die-hard reductionism progresses happened,  thanks to which techniques for minute and efficient inducing of gene conversion wherever needed will undoubtedly be available in a matter of years too[](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/37/19/6378/2409473 "Targeted gene conversion induced by triplex-directed psoralen interstrand crosslinks in mammalian cells (2009)")[](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34043941/ "Efficient embryonic homozygous gene conversion via RAD51-enhanced interhomolog repair (2021)")[^refconversion].

The reason why these methods were initially side-stepped in favor of more direct cut-and-past alternatives such CRISPR, was their inherent slowness and random nature, in the sense that such phenomena would normally occur under control of interrelated sequences underpinned by complex protein scaffoldings specific to meiosis. Without the possibility to control the place of insertion *precisely* the success rate of insertions would not exceed *a few percentages*.
Compounded with  **the low number of mature eggs in women, compounded by the rarity of very pure Nordic women**, and the inherently low success of the breeding protocole we envisioned with its less than 5% viable embryos ---even if infinitely superior--- would forbid the whole attempt entirely, thus cutting down the practical degree of consanguinity by a factor 10 to 20. Hardly a number conducive to any eugenics purpose.

Technical progress is ongoing, but real success will only ensue when the teachings of quantal genetics will preside: *cells do not see individual genes but entire PFBs at once*[](https://doi.org/10.1101/013755 "The Time-Scale Of Recombination Rate Evolution In Great Apes (2015)")[^more][^e], separated by efficient though fluid boundaries, mainly driven by the PRDM9 gene family. Mastery of directed gene conversion respectful of this structure would allow seamless and efficient manipulations without size limit.

*As for the issue of ovule scarcity*, [functional gamete creation](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-05834-x "Generation of functional oocytes from male mice in vitro (2023)") is already very close at hand.

#### Problelm with *in vitro* fertilization

There is another reason why genetic modification the way it is done today is problematic. In the natural case according to litterature[^embryo-loss-literature], natural conceptions include a 40% to 60% (within a 5% error margin) of embryo loss, hence a 5/3 (or 1.2) attempts per success for the lowest success rate to 2.2 attempts per success for the highest success rate.

Whereas the average overall pregnancy rate from IVF using fresh embryo transfers reached 29% in 2021, with the highest rate peaking at 41% for the age range 18-34 accoding to [official British sources](https://www.hfea.gov.uk/about-us/publications/research-and-data/fertility-treatment-2021-preliminary-trends-and-figures/ "Fertility treatment 2021: preliminary trends and figures"). So in the best of case the loss post fertilization is 59%, compared to 40% in the natural case, mostly because the techniques have improved considerably and both ovas and embryos are selected thoroughly on morphological criteria. Yet the failure rate is still higher, or maybe much so (but the level of precision of a clinical IVF study is for the moment technically challenging for the [natural case](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5443340/#:~:text=A%20recent%20re%2Danalysis%20of,vary%20substantially%20between%20individual%20women. "Early embryo mortality in natural human reproduction: What the data say, Gavin E. Jarvis (2016)"). It is estimated that most of the implantation or [pre-implantation losses][pre-clinical spontaneous abortions] alike are due to chromosomal instabilities, evidences indicating a higher rate for IVFs embryos than live ones.
{#reason}

It is believed that the failure of the culture medium to stand in accurately for the maternal environment even for the first few days: the same environment that we know now is reponsible for the selective nurturing or termination of embryos depending on their genetic health, as mentioned when we treated the role it played in weeding out rejects of [consanguineous unions](incest#stats), making them much safer than expected with statistics. The dialog between the mother and the child, from the moment of conception, exceeds by far what machines could simulate and [ectogenesis] in higher animals with stay a nightmare for good. Children born from artification insemination alone, might be susceptible to diseases because of the artificial conditions in a critical moment, leading to [epigenetic abberations](www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7026576/ "In Vitro Fertilization Technology and Child Health (2020)").

Because we discovered how much more efficient the human body is in selecting good sperm, tests improved that screen for morphological difformities (hinting at DNA fragmentation), leading to [higher success results](www.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0531.2009.01363.x "Is semen analysis useful to predict the odds that the sperm will meet the egg? (2009)"). Yet these artificial methods still leave late life health issues, because something as gross as a morphological anomaly most only would cause failure at fecundation and early development. It can not screen for traits impacting the whole life, while as mentioned above natural processes do. We cannot circumvent nature with impunity. *We would improve our knowledge of accumulated flaws by leaps and bounds, if we could benefit from the study a maximum of embryonic dejects in natural conditions* and not laboratory or in vitro experiments.

However all this only matters when it comes to nurturing a *full child*. The overwhelming majority of inbred rejects will not grow past the embyryonic stage, especially with raw food. In that context much can already be gleaned from imperfect culture conditions, if we learn to narrow down progressively the experiment, possibly with culture cells only, to identify the genetic flaws.
Then, when it comes to producing a healthy child (and not experimenting), in-vitro fertilization will be discarded in favor of yet-to-be-developped sophisticated methods in order to enact the desired fertilization inside mothers, in-vivo.  

#### Guideline for selective breeding

We adapted here a robust guideline for identifying flaws to eliminate from the gene pool which was meant to improve selective breeding of cattle:
```quote{cite="[Adapting Genetics: Quantum Evolution After Natural Selection-Surviving The Changes To Come](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Adapting-Genetics-Educating-Deposit-Evolution-ebook/dp/B0BJK8KDXP)"}
#### An alternative strategy for selective breeding

1. Define the blocks and their ancestral haplotypes in regions of interest
1. Develop robust haplospecific markers which allow at least more frequent haplotypes to be distinguished.
1. Confirm segregation in multi-generation families.
1. Compare candidate haplotypes to determine whether these have arisen by ancestral recombination events which can help to localise the operative components.
```
Because our breeding plans are substractive in nature (removing flaws), we do need to bother with negative in nature (the wish to substract) concerns about functional explanations of the association between faulty haplotypes and troubles observed are mostly not relevant, because troubles will mostly be revealed by **extensive embryonic screening**, which would also provide the immediate statistical evidence for the haplotype's harmfulness, though with the necessity to narrow down on the exact sequence to incriminate, by whatever means.
The initial screening would dismiss the need to prove associations or penetrance: from the point of view of purity, conditional flaws and systematic flaws are perfectly synonymous. At the end of that identification process, flaws would either amount to a foreign racial origin for the haplotype, or to an <q>operative components</q>.
That component will then identify as either a hazardous mutation whose pattern might be spotted to also brand other haplotypes, or as an erroneous breaking down or recombination of natural haplotypes, *possibly due to admixture*.

### Beyond selection

Lastly, I must straighten out that not every objectively undesirable trait can be singled out this way, even in the best case scenario. It is because I specifically mention flaws **borne from cooking** accumulated throughout millennia. These are chaotic mutations of a rather gross nature, typically so much so they do not sustain homozygous expression at least not in number.

They constitute the mutational load as commonly defined.
{.important}

But a lot of what separates us from Neanderthal, are rather **misadaptations**, **divergent mutations** fixating and changing our whole ontogenesis (development along species-specific morphological lines), without reduced lethality or even sublethality. Just gearing us toward different though objectively inferior courses of development,  weaker more fragile bodies and brains. Once we reach total purification down to the ground level of chaotic errors (infinitely small in raw primates, compared to insects or bacteria), how to go further toward full recovery of the Neanderthal phenotype ?

Motoo Kimura, a leader of the synthetic theory of evolution and later the neutral theory of molecular evolution (stating that most mutations are synonymous hence neutral and **random** drift being the principal driver of change) said very well:
> Even if in the distant future it will become possible to **freely replace DNA base pairs in the nucleus**, it is **premature** to think that the genetic qualities of the human can be freely improved. This is comparable to the notion that the blueprint for any splendid machine can be drawn provided paper and a pencil are available, and **ignores the higher dimensional problem of information**. Moreover, the conundrum exists of **how far the human can improve its brain by using its brain**.

Regardless of computers, what does the comprehension in last analysis is always the brain, and nothing ensures our brain can outdo millions of years of evolution nor is designed to understand itself totally. The intellect can not exceed itself by its own means. What Kimura couldn't know is that we don't evolve but devolve, so one simply needs to amplify the ancestral part of us:
we don't know why molecularly speaking the past was better, we just know it was from reasoning and looking at bones. And then Lamarckian mechanisms do not require our understanding either, we just need to set up the good conditions for their application.

Lastly, the brain does not only possess intellect [**but also the extrasensory, infinite in scope and depth and superseding everything material**](meta). Hence it open the path for a possible conscious **genetic improvement under divine guidance**, such as that Teilhard De Chardin would have called for.  Through [a comprehensive physical, physiological and cognitive conditioning](homofascism), fully integrated into a totalitarian culture pervading every aspect of our lives, we'll bring out the total potential of the genetic gifts of all children. As well as induce the self-evolution of our species through the feedback mechanisms revealed these last 50 years, by exposing ourselves willfully and systematically to the very limit of human experience and stress tolerance.

In a few centuries, we shall reach racial transcendence, repairing 40 000 years of errors. This shall become the life purpose for human existence in order to ascend to a new state of consciousness through ever higher levels of purity and cultural conditioning.

	To be more speciï¬c, a large RNA recombinant string is formed [â¦](#). The RT- priming step would be as envisaged for Somatic HyperMutation such that the nicked transcribed strand (TS) DNA with a free 3=-OH end anneals to the long modiï¬ed RNA thus allowing extension of the cDNA to produce a long newly synthesized transcribed strand with all the RNA mutations now embodied within the DNA strand 287 as SNPs (or indels, etc). The last steps would involve strand invasion, endonuclease action to remove the displaced resident strand âï¬apâ and then integration to seal the gap on the TS (via ligation). These events could happen during gametogenesis and meiosis and manifest as a biased or directional DNA conversion tract from one parental chromosome to another. It may involve alterations of the structure and position of recombination hotspot motifs, such as the PRDM9 gene, and their reallocation to the boundaries of the PFB and thus minimize recombination within the newly formed [PFB]. That is, the donor strand low in PRDM9 motifs would invade and convert the target strand to create a tract of low density PRDM9 motifs.

	In many eukaryotes, sites of meiotic recombination, also called hotspots, are regions of accessible chromatin, but in many vertebrates, their location follows a distinct pattern and is specified by PR domain-containing protein 9 (PRDM9). The specification of meiotic recombination hotspots is achieved by the different activities of PRDM9: DNA binding, histone methyltrans-ferase, and interaction with other proteins. Remarkably, PRDM9 activity leads to the erosion of its own binding sites and the rapid evolution of its DNA-binding domain. PRDM9 may also contribute to reproductive isolation, as it is involved in hybrid sterility potentially due to a reduction of its activity in specific heterozygous contexts.

	Estimates of embryonic death in most mammals, including swine, sheep, cattle, and humans, ranges from 20% to 40%, with two-thirds of the losses occurring during the peri-implantation period of pregnancy.
	During that stage of pregnancy, the dialog between the mammalian conceptus (embryo/fetus and associated membranes) and maternal uterus involves signaling for pregnancy recognition and maintenance of pregnancy as the stage is set for implantation and placentation that precedes fetal development. Uterine epithelial cells secrete and/or transport a wide range of molecules, including nutrients, collectively referred to as histotroph, that are transported into the fetalâplacental vascular system to support growth and development of the conceptus.

	By 1987, it was clearly established that each ancestral haplotype has a specific content of genomic features such as duplications and indels. These too are *actively conserved* and can themselves be used as signatures for haplotypes of hundreds of kilobases and even *megabases*. These observations were very difficult to explain in terms of any form of neo-Darwinism, natural selection, random errors or population genetics as taught then and today. Rather, we realised, the genome is not actually homogeneous but *partitioned into protected quanta or PFB*.

	3) random fluctuation of gene frequencies in small sections of the population (random genetic drift);

	Using the zebrafish Danio rerio, we show that selection on phenotypic variation among intact fertile sperm within an ejaculate affects offspring fitness. Longer-lived sperm sired embryos with increased survival and a *reduced number of apoptotic cells*, and *adult male offspring exhibited higher fitness*. The effect on embryo viability was carried over into the second generation without further selection and was equally strong in both sexes.
	This conclusion is further supported by the observation that selection for long-lived sperm resulted in increased offspring fitness in **every trait** that we examined, the opposite of what would be predicted if degradation arising from sperm aging had occurred. *Regardless of the exact genetic underpinning* of our observations, our findings are likely to have **major implications** for key evolutionary processes including the **rate of adaptation**, the evolution of a sexually dimorphic recombination rate, **the load of deleterious mutations, and the extent of inbreeding depression**.

	Adaptation to ecological conditions should not be limited to the allelic substitution in response to each fluctuation in the environment. A current alternative seems to be the fixing of complex epigenetic systems which respond adaptively to environmental flows in a phenotypic rather than genetic way. Characters such as developmental and genetic homeostasis, switching genes controlling phenotypic expression in heterogeneous environments, *pipes and experiential modification of behavior (learning), all allow and promote the development of favored phenotypes* in the face of considerable environmental disturbance. The fact that human populations are, and were largely dispersed geographically, assured the heterozygoty of the species even when local isolates are highly homozygous. *This ensured the survival of the species even in the event of local extinction.*

	The parathyroid gland helps maintain calcium levels in the blood. When the gland is removed (a *parathyroidectomy*), calcium levels decline.

Their newborn offspring experienced little decline in calcium during the first 24 hours of life even though parathyroidectomies had been carried out on them at birth.
	In other words, parathyroid removal from the mother rat protected the newborn from the effects of a similar operation. In a control experiment, mothers were not subjected to the operation whereas the offspring were. None of these offspring showed the protection evident in the previous experiment. In the final and most informative experiment, **a brother and sister** with a parathyroidectomized mother, but who were allowed to keep their thyroids, **were mated.
	The progeny of such unions produced newborn rats with a protective response upon having their parathyroids removed**. The effect persisted for four generations, the obvious implication being that an acquired trait, namely protection against parathyroid removal, is inheritable.

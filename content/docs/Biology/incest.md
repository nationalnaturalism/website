**Incest is the highest expression of self-love**, the very drive of racial evolution. For that reason, we must clear away the lies and antiquated misconceptions.
{.important}

It is the key to promoting a way of life and love transcending the division between a morally corrupt liberalism and an equally degenerate but more socially acceptable conservatism, embodying the Left/Right dichotomy, and [far from being detrimental to health](.#stats) incest when done right brings about the **genetic regeneration of the race**.
Cultural values usually never last beyond a few centuries, often degenerating before. Men live too short lives to expect any better. The only thing that overcomes time - beside the pyramids - is **blood** and the quality of any culture comes down to its effect on it. We profess that consanguinity is a natural fact meant to go hand in hand with a healthy selection, and that the absence of both is now creating tens of millions of degenerates at an alarming rate, signing the end of humanity *if incest doesn't come back on a large scale to [make the Nordic race pure again](eugenics)*.

## Anthropology

### Bronze Age Europe

- ![isis and osiris](/Images/spirituality/mythology/isis-osiris.webp "Isis and Osiris")
{.center}

Classical European cultures all over the continent stood in fact in complete diametrical opposition to the Abrahamic religions that spread from the Orient like a plague (and whose effects could be argued to be worse than the plagues themselves).  This carefree morale that founded Western culture was as distant from the common globohomo LGBTIQ+ pleasure-obsessed and self-centered modern cult of utter degeneracy praised in today's liberal circles, as to conservative "traditional" thinking.

Magic was a prominent part of culture: Seiðr, Spà, Galdr, Runesseiðr, sorcery, however we want to call it... Today we call it the metapsychics, or ESP for extrasensory perception. But it always existed in known history and beyond, down to our ape ancestry as opposed to most other lower lifeforms, knowing only breeding. Even in what we consider as modern neo-Liberal and *progressive* European countries such as Germany, incestuous couples and individuals are a heavily persecuted group, with their basic human rights removed upon the revelation of this deviancy in the eyes of the supposedly progressive state.

Reading from Norse Sagas, it appears clearly that in the original pan-European Nordic society that traditional social structures (marriages, trade) were merely formal customs, somewhat necessary to the functioning of society but of secondary importance in comparison to honor, bravery and integrity were paramount values. Freya and Freyr were twin god and goddess of sex and fertility, and lovers while married to others, while Odin's wife Frigg routinely slept with Odin's three brothers in his absence, with his approval and this was no secret. A give-and-take sort of agreement given Odin's own famous disregard of faithfulness, while Loki would shape-shift into a female horse, got humped by a stallion and *gave birth as a horse*.

**Promiscuity was the norm among gods**. Norse gods were especially fond of incest and very self-aware. The gods embraced freely their own deviancy, and it didn't hinder Norsemen and women to worship them. When all gods are debauchees, *debauchery* becomes moral.

We can deduce that these myths reflected the on-going fight, on a near conscious level, between the desire to fuck the brains out of your wide-eyed long-haired aryan sister mindless, and economic and social imperatives (clan politics, marriages) straying more and more from the immediate satisfaction of human needs, growing more and more parasitic, sucking people's life and demanding more and more submission of the individual. For Norse people this fight between society and men' wilderness had not been completely lost yet, until Christianity took over. 

### Levi-Strauss and the structuralists

The almost unanimous point of view in scientific circles, and beyond that the "popular wisdom" seems to be universal, is that incest is hated by nature, and fundamentally bad... Levi-Strauss even spread the idea, common today, that the whole of human civilization was the product of two things: cooking (there he was perhaps right), and the incest taboo, conceived as a victory over nature.

![Portrait of Levi Strauss](/Images/article_inceste/levi_strauss_1.webp)

The principle being that without this taboo (and the impossibility to be happy with your own relatives or members of your local community) there would be little to no incentive to meet with members of other families, hence to form a society. It entails that The origin of society itself (vs the mythical "free-for-all" animal state) originates, according to this Jew, **from the decision of all communities from a certain degree of development, to practice the exchange of wives**.

On the basis of Levi-Strauss, Witte[^disappearence_leavitt] formulated the [alliance/cooperation thesis](DFN):
: 	```quote{author="[Disappearance of the Incest Taboo: A Cross-Cultural Test of General Evolutionary Hypotheses (1989), pp. 116–31](http://www.jstor.org/stable/679741)" author="Leavitt, Gregory C."}
	[Leslie](#) Whites(1948) proposes that the rule of incest, in the strongest (taboo) terms, requires that individuals and groups seek economic and military cooperation through the institutions of family and marriage when other institutions such as government and economy (the state) are absent. *Going outside one's family and immediate group to seek a partner is rewarded with access to sex and other adult status and privileges.* These rewards provide a more personal incentive to extend social ties, going beyond the economic and military needs of the kinship group, community and/or society. The strength of this rule suggests the urgent cultural need for such alliances. Exceptions to these rules are relatively rare, and punishments usually harsh.
	```

In the same way these alliances are sometimes fundamental in a strategy of avoidance of the conflicts at the primitive ones: To Goodenough (1953) asked a tribe of the highlands of New Guinea "Can you marry with such a group?"" their positive answer was often "Yes, we fight". These theses have a certain merit, but they also become full of contradictions as soon as one wants to lend them an absolute or even worse, evolutionary character, assuming a universality that is wholly invalidated by the facts.

The seminal [Disappearance of the Incest Taboo: a Cross-cultural test of General Evolutionary Hypotheses](https://www.jstor.org/stable/679741) takes into account a broad study of the incest question in 121 societies. Though we do not agree on purely materialistic explanations, it is interesting to see how in general, contrary to <q>common sense</q> in societies we call "primitive", first degree incest was actually not the most vilified degree, as it wasn't socially the most disruptive regards to the Alliance theory. **Cousin marriage is**[](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00066449 "Thornhill, N. An evolutionary analysis of rules regulating human inbreeding and marriage (1991)").

Beside, this theory wouldn't account for the persistence of such rationally motivated prohibitions long after any economic or social drive has died out, effectively taking on a life on its own, **hinting a deeper, unconscious endogenous origin**.

Sigmund Freud (a Jew keenly aware of the peculiarities of his own culture and hypocrisy of this time) thought, on the contrary, that our natural instinctive drive would rather have us pursue and appropriate our daughters, mother and sisters, freeing us from the need to establish a properly human relationship with others or to restrain our behavior in any way.

![Freud's Totem and Tabu and Malaise in civilization](/Images/article_inceste/freud_totem-und-tabu-cover+malaise_civ.webp) 

Freeing us from the shackles of unnatural social constraints, absolutely. At the core we remain animals. **Modern human relations**, have always been built on a fundamental inner want, both creating the handicap and providing the clutch, in the form of institutions, such as marriage and religion (at least the neurotic part of it). Sexual repression, coextensive with the progress of culture sublimated more and more sexual energy into forced outbreeding - prohibiting the fulfillment of Oedipus (the subconscious romantic affinity for our parents) renders man forever incapable of total and ineffable abandon in love, the dissolving into the *Id* (in French the "Ça", English "It", the well of instincts and desires), **incapable of regaining the undivided unity of the child suckling its mother**.

At the same time, civilization would guarantee order and calm, an order that domesticated external nature (wild animals, crops, etc.) as much as it did our internal nature, allowing one to no longer be at the mercy of other tyrannical "I's", who are as little inclined to take your interests into account as you are to take theirs.

On the other hand... Sociobiologists, a school nowadays very popular, simply postulates an instinctive horror of incest, a kind of negative imprinting from those raised with us, that evolution must have selected to avoid consanguinity. Yet upon further analysis this stance appears as groundless as farcical, both from a social and **biological standpoint** as is demonstrated in the next section.

### Flawed postulates

The limit of acceptable endogamy changes a lot from place to place and time to time, and even in cultures with strong consciousness about the "danger" of incest, we may find the actual repression not matching its description, and in some context absent. Starting with structuralists: They confused love (and sexuality) with marriages, while until the XVIIIth century in the West the general rule has always been their separation.

The idea that the social order can only be maintained by forcing young men into obedience in exchange for sexual satisfaction in the form of marriage, is silly. After all, of either sex men have always been (by far) the least bound by marital ties, as obvious with the omnipresence of prostitution at all times, or other extramarital loves including homosexual ones. In fact such outlets were often encouraged especially in the upper classes, as the guarantors of social order. When push comes to shove, one'd rather fuck a random hoe than the mayor's daughter !

Roman patricians, the poster child of patriarchy, conceived marriage as a necessary evil to ensure the continuity of the state. Hardly as a moral matter. In antiquity the fidelity of Roman men has never been required before Christianity, while for women the concern was expressly to avoid polluting the family bloodline, with genitors whose value no one could ascertain.

On the other hand, adoption was common especially among nobles, even for girls despite their absence of matrimonial use. This must be replaced in its original context where pure Patricians had to suffer the racial danger (and potential sexual predation) of inferior swarthier plebeians. This suffices to show that marriage was originally and for the longest time, a very natural eugenic urge to ascertain an offspring's racial purity or worth (notions originally synonymous)  and not a neurotic need to enforce some egotic need for possessivity as displayed by the likes of Islamists. Many literary examples lead to fairly different and carefree portraits of Roman morals[^carefree]. Saturnalia also regularly saw real orgies take place, without participants being held responsible.

And beyond the dramatic importance *incestus* has in Roman legal and religious (synonymous words for them...) writings, we should stop and consider **what** consequence and punishment it really brought.
"Incestus" meant a wild variety of things, but mostly two. Sex with a Vestale, punished by death, and intercourse within the forbidden degrees of consanguinity, including first degree incest.
The latter was merely punished by **relegatio** which meant "the mildest form of exile, involving banishment from Rome, but not loss of citizenship, or confiscation of property". But evidence shows that in Rome for incestuous couples willing to live outside Rome itself but anywhere else in any other city, there seemingly was no real consequences.

```quote {.aside}
Epictetus praised a stoic senator who heard he had been condemned in his absence:- To exile, says he, or to death?
- To exile
- What about my property?
- It has not been confiscated
- *Well then, let us go to Arica [first stop outside Rome](#) and take our lunch there*.
```

The real engine of social change has always been the perception of the sacred and the transcendent, projected on all sorts of things. Sex when it comes to deep cultural changes, takes its value much less from the procreative side of things, than to its innate association with the sacred. The idea that men may be possessed of transcultural innate desires driving piloting history is just not conceivable for sociology, explicitly denying any transcendance, in the purest marxist/Jewish tradition.

As a matter of fact the overwhelming majority of cultures studied so far that do condemn incest both ancient and extant only concern themselves with **mariages** (relative to whatever kinship system is in usage), **not sexual relationships themselves**. I could only find one researcher realizing the incongruity of what amounts to a grave and systematic case of cognitive dissonance or conceptual myopia, leading to a complete disregard of love outside matrimony as a culturally-significant reality.

```quote{cite="Incestuous and Close-Kin Marriage in Ancient Egypt and Persia An Examination of the Evidence" author="Paul John Frandsen" .aside}
Some scholars see the requirement to marry outside the close kinship group as derived from prohibitions on sexual relations, while others assume that the rules governing this choice of spouse (exogamy) account for the prohibitions on sexual intercourse.
It goes without saying that if society has established a permanent prohibition against a sexual relationship between two individuals, no marriage between them will be possible. *But a marriage prohibition does not necessarily imply a prohibition against a **sexual relationship***. Marriage, to mention the most important difference, is usually a *public affair* which establishes *relationships between groups*.
```

History and anthropology suffer greatly from the over-reliance on texts, considered as an objective source of information on people's thinking, instead of what they really are, normative discourses made by and for a certain class, a story we wish to tell about ourselves or others.

In Greece, (in Athenes at least) only incest through the maternal line was considered, so half-siblings from the father side could marry several famous philosophers could openly discuss that topic[^Greek], which after all did not have the omnipotence we would assume from the same people that gave us the Oedipus complex.
Samewise, Plato's Republic[^Plato] describes a rational society in which knowing telling apart one's siblings was discouraged, and actual incest *sanctioned by the gods*. Stoicism and Cynics also criticized the arbitrariness of the taboo.

Thus it stands to reason that such concepts were not, in fact, so horrifying to contemplate for Greeks. And they only really disliked mother-son relationships, though well-known philosophers (Stoics in particular) did run counter to this taboo, of course without any repercussions. Overall Greeks cared **far** more about the respect of personal property and political rights than we do, and people were free to do as they pleased, as long as it did not  not impede others, their properties or defile the few religious places.

Moreover, several cultures far from fearing it, **openly [worshiped](.#Persia) incest**. The most notorious (not the only one) were the Persians.

### Sociobiology

From the beginning of the late 1960s, a growing number of biologists, sociobiologists, evolutionary psychologists and anthropologists started supporting the hypothesis. Despite unceasing important critiques. Leading to global unanimity. Darwinian social scientists have come to regard the Westermarck hypothesis as an indisputable truth, with highly distinguished statements such as these: In 1998 Lieberman and symons declared that the proposition to early cohabitation leads to sexual aversion "must be fairly obvious to anyone who has not been indoctrinated with the crippling dogmas of freudianism or the social sciences".
But the [Westermarck hypothesis] has been proved wrong[](https://dx.doi.org/10.4236/sm.2013.31008 "Tylor vs. Westermarck: Explaining the Incest Taboo, Gregory Leavitt (2013)")[](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26014825/ "The Westermarck Hypothesis and the Israeli Kibbutzim: Reconciling Contrasting Evidence (2015)")[](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/597178 "Incest Avoidance, the Incest Taboo, and Social Cohesion: Revisiting Westermarck and the Case of the Israeli Kibbutzim (2009)") experimentally at multiple occasions, including the pioneering (albeit lying) study that served to promote it, the famous Kibboutz study.

This foundation study that cemented the sociobiological view of incest avoidance was a description of young people's life in an Israeli Kibbutz in 1959, reported in [1971](https://sci-hub.ru/10.1007/bf01638058 "Mate selection among second generation kibbutz adolescents and adults: Incest avoidance and negative imprinting (1971)"). The Kibbutz study in question was supposed to show, in Israeli groups of children raised together communally, that mere close proximity in those formative years was enough to trigger the incest avoidance mechanism, and cancel or invert any sexual feeling between such young people as if they were relatives.
Though the study was judged conclusive and stayed the main (nay, only) "proof" of the negative imprinting hypothesis (a version of the innate incest avoidance involving not much kin detection but common upbringing), **it was in reality plagued with denials, damnable mishaps of judgment and a sorely lack in scientific method**. His only redeeming quality was to not outright falsify the data, as one could have expected from someone working with the horrible Jewess Judith Reismann.

To quote Lieber:
```quote{cite="[Instinctive Incest Avoidance: A Paradigm Case for Evolutionary Psychology Evaporates, Justin Lieber (2006)](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-5914.2006.00313.x)"}
But Shleper described 1960s kibbutzim, **which though Shleper denies and ignores this, strongly cultivated and systematically enforced a no privacy and no-sex-before-marriage atmosphere**, which the youngsters only escaped when they all entered compulsory military service in their late teens, when they had their first opportunities for dating and courtship, although **even then under strong parental and communal pressure to marry members, not of their own, but of nearby kibbutzim (which was, shades of Levi-Strauss, intended to strengthen the ties between the kibbutzim communities)**. [...](#) Moreover, re-examination of  Shlepher’s data suggest **serious gaps between Shleper’s interpretation and the data**

In any case, **several marriages did occur** unnoticed by Shleper that violated his claim that “not a single case of intra-peer group marriage occurred”.
{.important}
```

Despite common features, not all kibbutz movements were the same and some were relatively more conservative about youth sexual matters, some maintaining sleeping arrangements and shower arrangements to avoid temptations until a later age. Shepherd's statement was directly opposed by numerous studies, pointing at the fact that indeed **social scripts** in many kibbutzim, rejected the idea of romantic or sexual relations between co-reared peers. Leavitt argued that **according to Shepherd himself**children of the same peer group engaged in intense sexual play with one another until the age of 9 or 10, which was inconsistent with the theory of negative imprinting and sexual aversion.

Shor and simchai (in a study of Asian « minor marriages », involving adopting a young child bride before marrying her) found that a number of sociocultural factors were important in explaining differences in attraction levels and romantic/sexual relationships avoidance. Most important among these factor was social cohesion and **fears of hurting the integrity of the group**. Other factors reported as important in preventing romantic and sexual relationships were age homologs and the general atmosphere in the kibbutzim, often reported to be **intolerant of over sexuality in general and of romantic and sexual relations withing the peer group in particular**.

Importantly they also controlled for those who had indeed passed their full youth reared together, while it is true that a part of kibbutzim youth now have had significant time spent with their families, hence theoretically lessening peer negative sexual imprinting. *According to them, the sample controlled for this variable, on average showed attraction toward co-reared peers in later years and almost none of them developed feelings of sexual aversion*.

Lastly, [Canadian scientists](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1090513899000410 "A test of the revised Westermarck theory, Irene Bevc and Irwin Silverman") demonstrated that in a less sexually repressive upbringing siblings show actually a very strong sexual attraction. 170 subjects related their experiences while having been separated (then subsequently reunited) from their siblings (of opposite sex) during early childhood. What they noted, at their surprise was the overwhelming **attraction** of incest rather than its repulsion. with both sexual activity groups *reporting significantly more* nudity and physical contact with siblings during childhood than subjects reporting no sexual activity. 

> Respondents reporting potentially procreative, post-childhood sexual acts (attempted or completed genital intercourse) with siblings were compared with those reporting sexual relationships excluding procreative acts, and a third sample reporting no post-childhood sibling sexual behavior. Consonant with expectations from the earlier study, prolonged separation during early childhood was associated with procreative post-childhood sexual activity but not with other post-childhood sexual activity. Contrary to predictions, however, **both sexual activity groups reported significantly more nudity and physical contact with siblings during childhood than subjects reporting no sexual activity**.

This concludes the final dismantling of the sociobiological *clique*.

## Natural eugenics

### Inbreeding

Extensive experiments were conducted in this spirit long before our modern methods and concepts of genetics and molecular biology were developed. Helen Dean King (1869-1955), showed that the failures and degeneration first encountered in her inbred rat farm were not only due solely to their poor nutrition, but also prove reversible as nutrition changed.

![Photograph of Helen King working on rats](/Images/biology/eugenics/helen-dean-king-rats.webp)

Laboratory mice tolerate this kind of reproductive regime for generations, also without side effects, or so weak that they are invisible to natural selection (leaving for example to the mother, whose sense of smell is very good, the care of rejecting the abnormal young). In fact, genetic variety is the enemy of breeding and of any selection insofar as it hides the traits we are looking for and that we have spent years or decades to bring out.

```quote{cite="[Genetic studies in the Amish and Mennonites](https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00359580)"}
The Amish and Mennonite peoples have a high rate of intermarriage within their individual communities, with a resulting high incidence of inherited disorders. Many of these disorders, such as cartilage-hair hypoplasia, Ellis-van Creveld syndrome, and others, are rarely seen outside these communities.
```
```quote{cite="[Health among the Amish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_among_the_Amish)" .aside}
Health among the Amish is characterized by higher incidences of particular genetic disorders, especially among the Old Order Amish. These disorders include dwarfism, Angelman syndrome, and various metabolic disorders, such as Tay-Sachs disease, as well as an unusual distribution of blood types.
```

Most deleterious mutations are associated with a defective gene failing to produce a function protein, or any protein at all. When said mutations are inherited from one parent only, they usually do not express so the issue is naturally when family members breed with one another, giving their child a high probability of inheriting the defective gene on both genes of a pair of chromosomes (homozygosity).

![Shields' seminal book cover](/Images/biology/eugenics/book_shields_cover.webp)

The biggest cause of incest's misdeeds, is the refusal to let natural selection apply, the interference of religious, social or ethical considerations, **such as taking  care of abnormal babies, or weak children.**

This kind of attitude, which places greater value on individuals than on the **vital qualities** they manifest, is an old Christian legacy and beyond a Judaic one. For an orthodox Jew there is nothing more sacred than a Jewish life.
Instead, Pagan beliefs and the firsthand experience of extrasensory perception teach us the immortality of consciousness. Ergo, for those with the misfortune of a terrible birth, physically disabled or worse, intellectually, death is not a problem because their souls will find a better body.

Not to sterilize (at least) the disabled and handicapped is the end of natural selection. Defective genes pollute the good ones and good health, strength, intelligence, any desirable quality, become in a few decades of intensive indiscriminate breeding, a thing of the past.

The humane and logical solution is sterilization and adoption, a policy still followed by many civilized nations until the 1960s. It is an absolute necessity, as mere inbreeding without selection only causes defective alleles to settle and increase in frequency in human groups like the Amish, and physically degenerates individuals multiply. In the case of domestic animals, we select but for arbitrary economic or aesthetic criteria instead of reinforcing fitness, resulting in degenerate races incapable to compete with their wild equivalents without the care of men, or survive at all.

When homozygosity of bad alleles occurs in an offspring this may be for the unfortunate parents, this comes with some perks: the more genetic flaws are highlighted, the easier the selection and thus their elimination from the patrimony for the generations to come. Complete (properly incestuous) inbreeding allows this. It is **incomplete** inbreeding which degenerates us, in a society in which thanks to technology and agriculture survival does not depend on individual fitness any longer, by not lowering survivability enough to screen out bad alleles.

This phenomenon is called [genetic purge](DFN)[^purge][](www.doi.org/10.1002/evl3.229 "Mutation load decreases with haplotype age in wild Soay sheep (2021)"):
: Some lines concentrate the defects, others the qualities, and those drawing the shortest straw will be eliminated by predators, because of a reduced fitness. In fact the bulk of natural selection acts before birth in the womb, making the whole thing much less bloody than we tend to imagine.
{.important}

Another inherent strength of inbreeding is the *conservation of non-additive genetics* . Due to epistasy and trans interactions, all complex traits are highly multigenic and might not be possible to isolate from other traits in a mendelian fashion. The best way to preserve those traits depending precise combinations, is group or family selection: one gets a much better idea of a person' hereditary potential by looking at its family and *breeding the family as a whole*. Otherwise, breeding high IQ people whose family is only sub-average would produce an **outlier** unable to pass on its qualities. That is why ideas like race-blind or "IQ nationalism" are nonsense: similar qualities in different races (for instance, skull size) depend on different and sometimes incompatible coadapted genes, which run much deeper than the eye can see.

Races separated by tens to hundreds of thousands of years, even of comparable brain size, can not blend satisfyingly: our mind, qualities and tendencies originate from separate factors, separate evolutive pathways, and in absence of extrasensory directives, should remain separate. Moreover, seemingly successful outliers among mixed individuals, always revert toward the statistical means of their race(s)[](ADD_REF "find stats about iq reverting to the mean of the races"). Even in plants hybrid vigor can not lead to the creation of stable lines: the "happy" combination (usually from an economic perspective only) obtained that way do not always breed true, because subsequent recombinations quickly dismantle them, despite the most elaborate breeding scheme. Evolution either marks such an approach with sterility, or *condemns it to countless generations of misadaptation and mediocrity*.

In the animal world, it is the universal occurrence of incest that we observe, not its taboo. All types, vertical (intergenerational) or horizontal (intragenerational, typically between uterine germans... brothers and sisters), a fact much more common knowledge and noticed in the early XXth century. Strangely enough Nature seems to change according to our certitudes of the moment...
Although we still find honest research showing undeniable facts, there is a terrible omerta on the subject. Well known is the fact among those who have observed tigers for instance, that brother-sister incest isn't a rare occurrence.

Beside, men have have had the leisure to observe these same experimental results (of the innocuity of inbreeding in animals) for **millenia** - eons before any notion of genetics or degeneration could ever cross their mind - through the practice of husbandry and livestock farming from the early Neolithic age circa 13 000 BC: it is the *benefits* of inbreeding and endogamy in improving any and all beneficial traits (strength, resilience, size, productivity) which has been obvious to all. The starking incongruity between this fact and the current diffusion of incest taboos was keenly noted by Lévi-Strauss.

But more importantly, what we just established here had actually been the unanimous opinion among scientists all along until 1963. From 1868 to 1963, it was the unanimous scientific opinion that the incest taboo was unfounded and [inbreeding harmless to excellent](https://annas-archive.org/md5/b8a7a2ee87656155e2c1a71a3bf37ef5 "Inbreeding, Incest, And The Incest Taboo The State of Knowledge at the Turn of the Century, from Arthur P. Wolf").
{.important}

Those very same conclusions based on genetics we just established, have actually always been common sense for any sensible mind, and Levi-Strauss and Leslie White[^leslie_white] themselves agreed on the inexistence of any biological foundation, and that the only reason inbreeding could cause cause issues - **if** it was to cause any - was because it highlighted flaws already present:

```quote{author="Claude Lévi-Strauss"}
East’s work has indirectly established that these supposed dangers would never have appeared if mankind had been endogamous from the beginning.
The temporary danger of exogamous unions, supposing such a danger to exist, obviously stems from an exogamous or pangenetic tradition, but it cannot be the cause of this tradition.
```
It is very important to realize that Darwin and Westermarck had been previously ridiculed for their fear of consanguinity, on the ground that husbandry and cross-breeding on the contrary had proven through the ages extremely potent in improving all desirable qualities in breeds.

[^leslie_white]:
	```quote{author="Leslie White" cite="[Inbreeding, Incest, And The Incest Taboo (P. Wolf)](https://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=4520)"}
	[In societies where brother-sister marriage is permitted in the ruling family,](#) we may find excellence. Cleopatra was the offspring of brother-sister marriages continued through several generations and she was "not only handsome, vigorous, intellectual, but also prolific... as perfect a specimen of the human race as could be found in any age or class of society".
	```

Opinions switched suddenly with the publication of new genetic molecular studies. Information leading authorities to conclude that "the ratio of deleterious and lethal recessive genes to selectively advantageous genes is very high indeed" and "the biological advantages of the familial incest taboo cannot be ignored". While in reality what was ignored was the wild disparity in genetic quality between both ethnicities and groups within them.

Studies made with South India Pakistan and Japan, all countries of doubtful if not disgusting racial origins - plus only allowing *incomplete* incest and refraining from any form of eugenics - rated the excess mortality at 16 to 20% and the total morbidity fo first degree incests to **22 to 36%**.

As shown later by non-extrapolative but concrete statistics with real incestuous partners *of a decent stock* debunk those delusional figures . If the specter of national-socialism and World War II had not plagued everyone's minds, the inanity of averaging such figures over whole population - then generalizing to all humanity - would have struck as nonsensical from the get-go.

Incomplete selection (such as laws favoring cousin marriages but not closer, or marrying according to wealth and not hereditary qualities) amounts to constantly stirring up the blood, increasing heterozygosity, blurring the line between good blood and bad blood. To get rid of genetic flaws, they must be allowed to express themselves, or no selection can occur, hence no improvement, and *the eventual fixation of bad but non-lethal traits*.

Hence Pakistan, other Arab countries and the Habsburg family, all being the results of partial consanguinity with actively impeded natural selection. On the contrary, inbreeding not only occurs frequently in natural populations but is in fact characteristically adaptive in many social, territorial, long-lived, low-birth-rate populations. Shields gives several examples of close inbreeding in great ape species.

### Philopatry

Philopatry (living and reproducing in the same place) and endogamy (reproducing with those close to you genetically), leads to inbreeding whether it be animals or plants, because you necessarily have spend more time, so have more opportunity to breed with relatives by living in the same place.

It appears that *low dispersion is the norm in nature*, in plants or animals, *contradicting the notion that one must spread and conquer new territories*. It also implies that new generations inherit an environment identical or very similar to that of the parents. Hence a constant selective pressure, going in the same direction. These conditions *theoretically disfavor sexual reproduction*, as it inevitably halves the material inherited, from the perspective of each parent. Instead, an unchanging environment would promote cloning or **inbreeding**, as an individual will pass more of its own alleles to its offspring by bonding with close relatives, sharing most of its blood.

So in a few generations a population can drastically reduce its overall mutational load. **Addition of new blood might allow for an healthier first hybrid generation, but it only masks the defects that have not been eliminated yet, or might have fixed due to genetic drift** (random high variation in allele frequency, which comes with too short of a breeding population).
But hybrid vigor quickly disappears as a corresponding amount of bad alleles also polluted the gene pool, perhaps in greater quantity than present in the consanguineous population but which were silent until now, hidden by heterozygosity (the presence in a single instance), and **all the selection work must be redone.**[^shields4]

> More so, Charli said, than what we’ve always done, when you look at it that way. Every generation a new exogene, the blood kept churning up, each new organism full of pressures which haven’t had a chance with the environment.
{.aside .important}

Complex adaptations originating from a large number of genes, are established by selection on a very large number of more or less genetically isolated extended families or *demes*. Whatever the challenge or environmental change this variation ensures the continuation of the species. More importantly a favorable adaptation will not disappear in reproduction or at least is bound to reappear in subsequent generations.

With time selection may fix the adaptive traits so that all of the demes share it. Then competition might determine which group represents the future of the species. While this dispersal is often cited as a strong argument for incest avoidance primates, this is incorrect and has more to do with an instinctive mechanism to regulate population-size in accordance to the ecological bearing capacity (how much food there is). Theoretically, dispersal limits inbreeding but only moving very far (to the point of incurring a high cost in fitness) suppresses it completely[^dispersion]. As expected, chimpanzees---the school case example of juvenale dispersion supposed to reflect incest avoidance---do show incest, and commonly at that in that case of juveniles with their mother[^juveniles], but also adults too[^adults].

### The truth of statistics {#stats}

Quite enough studies have been done concerning first cousin marriages, not lacking in large samples considering it stays a customary practice in many countries, concluding in a negligible excess mortality, not warranting public concern or justifying any stigma. Though first degree incest ("true" incest) is not illegal everywhere, especially in Europe (see [this map](https://thefinalmanifesto.blogspot.com/2015/01/global-map-of-incest-laws.html)), the relative rarity of such couples forming a family plus the moral burden, makes the job of statisticians rather complicated. Nevertheless there are two main meta-studies with a limited but substantial sample size (between 100 to 250), allowing an estimation of how health trouble at different stage of their life, the offspring of incest (up to second degree incest) can be expected to suffer from, **in absence of additional care such as genetic testing** or in vitro fecundation with embryo selection. From these we conclude to the *dismantling of the myth of an equivocal correlation between close inbreeding, mental retardation and health issues*. 

#### National Society of Genetic Counselors

The first study, directed by the National Society of Genetic Counselors, compiled 4 different other studies for a total of 213 children.

```quote{cite="[Genetic Counseling and Screening of Consanguineous Couples and Their Offspring: Recommendations of the National Society of Genetic Counselors](www.doi.org/10.1023/a:1014593404915)"}
This analysis does not control for non-genetic variables [aka: food !](#). In the two studies for which non-consanguineous reference groups were available, 8% of the control children (9 of 113) died or had a serious defect (Carter, 1967; Seemanova, 1971). Thus, the excess level of death and severe defect in the offspring of incestuous unions (a proportion of which may have been non-genetic in origin) was 31.4% (Bittles, in press).

[...](#)The risk for adverse medical outcomes in the offspring of incestuous unions is probably in the range of 7–31% above population background, the risk being greatest in the 1st year of life.

The reason of this weirdly variable rate, is the Czechoslovakian study from 1971 making up half the sample, and **I feel little doubt in dismissing this sub-sample as quite unrepresentative from the average population to say the least:** 
Information on fathers was less complete; most of them were in prison at the time of the examination and could not be contacted. Of 138 fathers, 8 were diagnosed as mentally subnormal, 13 were classified as chronic alcoholics according to the documents of the courts, 4 had committed suicide after the disclosure of their incestuous relations, and 2 were found to have acquired lues.
The group of 52 control fathers is entirely different from the fathers of the incestuous unions. The necessity of secrecy made the examination of this group of fathers difficult and in many cases even impossible. None of them were known to be mentally retarded.
```

It is not revealed why the fathers were in prison at the time, it could because of the incest itself as the [section 188 of the criminal code of the Czech republic] State criminalizes incest in and of itself, with 1 to 3 years of jail. Or it could for other reasons, **since the educational level of the parents was below average**: 4 females and 2 males had attended secondary school, while the remaining had attended elementary school only. They might as well be called "mentally impaired" or "criminally insane", including the scientists who thought it could be in any way representative of consanguinity.
And while such issues aren't **entirely** genetically-determined intelligence is known to be about 40% inheritable: Hence mating congenital idiots of the same family together is unlikely to bear the same fruits as mating your average Joe and his sister Joan. I think it explains both the variance and high ceiling in the figure of **7-33% above the norm** while the more recent following "amateur" study with mostly normal people or perhaps slightly above average in terms of awareness and education.

#### Study two, on 226 inbred children {#meta study}

The second study is the result of amateur efforts to see the truth in this matter, by interrogating incestuous couples not in prison or mental institutes or anything special, but on the contrary *rather above average people*, in terms of education and sensibility. The results prove once and for all, that incest in and of itself, is no doom, but on average a boon we bestow onto children.
  
```quote{cite="[The Consanguinamory Reproduction Study… The results are in!](https://consanguinamory.wordpress.com/2018/09/12/the-consanguinamory-reproduction-study-the-results-are-in/)" .aside}
This leaves us with a sample size of 115 couples who between them had 226 children (136 Girls, 88 Boys, 1 Intersex and 1 Gender Undisclosed)
21 of the children suffered from an illness, 14 of which the participant specified as a ‘common illness’ These included allergies, asthma, autism. Four of the children suffered from illness or disability which the participant is certain is down to inbreeding, and five are unsure what caused the illness as it is uncommon.
16 children had learning disabilities (16/226 x100 = 7.1%), 9 of which were also specified as children suffering from an illness.
If we were to exclude children suffering from common illnesses (eg. asthma) and learning disabilities (eg. ADHD) which occur frequently in the children of regular couples, we get (28-14)/226 x 100 = 6.2%.

**2nd Generation inbreeding**
:	42 children were born from parents who were themselves conceived by related parents. Of these children:
	- 8 had a common illness, 
	- 4 had learning disabilities, bringing the total to 12. 12/42 x 100 = 28.6%
```

The risk more than doubles for the second generation. However *asthma flu etc have nothing to do with genes and disappear entirely with instincto*. In mammals - assuming a natural diet - the idea of a higher sensibility to viruses stands out as highly dubious for they are [*helpers*](viral_phenomenon). And according to [statistics](https://www.crossrivertherapy.com/learning-disabilities-statistics) one child over 5 in the US have learning disabilities such as ADHD and dyslexia, euphemistically named "learning and thinking differences", so 25%. No significant difference with second generation incest children. 

Conditions like asthma - even chronic - and especially allergies, are all the result of *inflammation and autoimmune reactions in which the immune system starts attacking cooked/polluted molecules in one's own cells*, after receiving a triggering jolt from a pollen grain or non-self chemical.

In short, it can very well be considered a **good sign** to be ill in a highly polluted context such as cooking, despite no one ever seeing it as such. Your immune system is alive, and hasn't given up yet. The fact it goes too far - the income of unnatural molecules continues unabated ! - makes no difference.

Hence, we can safely remove the learning disabilities as 4/42 merely matches the American average. That leaves 19% of common diseases, which we might or might not consider significant, since I don't know the American average, but I am positive it would not express at all with instincto: many people came to treat asthma and saw symptoms progressively diminish until either they stopped, or the people stopped instincto and the symptoms returned. No other "common disease" ever continued chronically.

*No mental retardation is mentioned at all in this study save maybe for those 4 genetic conditions not explicit*. No "learning disabilities" were observed in children born instincto, and many of those taken care of who before had poor results in school, showed a spectacular academic comeback.

So we should revise those figures according to the criteria above, leaving just a 4% risk for first generation first degree incest (inbreeding coefficient 25%) and if we want to ignore the learning disabilities (which are not proved genetic), 0% for the second generation. Even forgetting about raw food for a moment, the *additional* morbidity indicated in that sample simply doesn't allow for catastrophism.
> The overall risk of a child being unhealthy in the first generation is 12.4%, in real terms a one in 8 chance. This may sound like terrible odds, but when you consider that this figure includes common chronic conditions which are also becoming increasingly prevalent in the regular population also, and that when these conditions are excluded, and we include only uncommon problems (which are more likely to be expressed with two copies of the same defective gene), and problems we know for sure are a direct result of consang reproduction (only 1.8%), the ADDED[emphasis in the text](#) *risk is a mere 6.2%*. Odds are strongly in your favor that nothing is going to go wrong as a direct result of consanguinamory, providing that your parents are not related.
{#real_risk}

The simple truth is, if your sample includes a significant proportion of low-life morons, you are likely to produce even worst morons, while due to the masking of recessive alleles, outbreeding in those cases is likely to result in better offspring than their congenitally stupid mothers. Consanguinity only magnifies the background.

![two-header-babies](/Images/biology/two-headed_baby.webp "*Here goes the two‑headed baby*")

![Image of the pope embracing a Downie](/Images/biology/pope_downsyndrome.webp)


The result of such inbreeding will depend a lot on the intensity of the selection. 
 - Do we sterilize children with any abnormality ?
 - Or do we develop a religion where natural beauty and health have ceased to be criteria in the choice of a spouse, and the life of any creature with more or less human traits becomes sacred in the eyes of God?


This will determine whether the result should be up with supermen... or with a Habsburg whose last one could no longer walk. In any case, a society which condones the reproduction of Downies does not have the right to condemn incest on either moral or health concerns.

```quote{cite="Down's syndrome abortion law doesn't respect my life" author="**BBC**" .danger}

**A woman with Down's syndrome** who is challenging abortion law's stance on babies with the condition says the legislation *doesn't respect my life*.

### True origin of the taboo

By uncovering the real nature of sexual taboos, such as the one against pedophilia, there is more chance to be heard, and change oneself. These elements of understanding drawn from metapsychoanalysis and instinctotherapy are absolutely new over thousands to tens of thousands of years, and might actually make a difference.

In the 1980's, a term appeared in the media, designating an irresistible attraction between two people of the same family, reunited in adulthood after years of separation, usually in the context of adoption. GSA stands for Genetic Sexual Attraction. According to people working in this field, this would concern the majority of cases of reunions in adulthood. The attraction is so irresistible as to break up the respective families each partner made, children included. The sexual sensations are described as of a transcendent order, beyond any comparison with ordinary sexuality.

![Picture of a girl's face while orgasming](/Images/memes/govern_me_harder_yes_daddy_female_orgasm_face.webp "An actually rather accurate illustration:")
{.no_auto}

We find here a common point between incest, pedophilia and pederasty. If the numerous testimonies found here by the excellent Keith Pullman, coming from people of all social backgrounds and involved in a wide range of different types of incestuous relationships, are honest, one could conclude that the incestuous relationship is in itself a source of energy, as would be shown by the lasting sensations of joy and deep complementarity.

We should stick preferentially with their immediate family including fathers while profiting from the presence of a broader spectrum of role models, regardless of common blood according to energetic affinities. Definitely familial ties shall last a lifetime. Mothers **and fathers** should involve themselves imparting all their knowledge and skills as much as practically possible and later on breed with their offspring if the right conditions present themselves. Hence, societies should align with these instincts by favoring small energetically and dietary independent consanguineous settlements, within the limits of contemporary economic necessities.

While inquiring about visions prescient dreams or other parapsychic experiences is out of the question due to the very limited sample (and most of all the absence of a standardized survey method) the sheer outlandish sexual potency alone suffices to conclude: that incest must be the most natural thing in the world and the most potent form of love, raising the strongest feelings of bliss.

**This is the true reason behind the taboo.**
{.important}

This creates unhappiness at various levels, organic (lack of really satisfying orgasms or orgasms at all for the woman) up to existential suffering, disconnecting from the spiritual dimension requires a clarity and peace of mind promptly destroyed by unconscious longings rotting into insanity.

[And this started since the end of the Paleolithic](https://mariecachet.wordpress.com/), presumably around 40,000 years ago, while the Neolithic (6000 to 2200 B.C.), started a vicious circle that grew ever more terrible with the development of agriculture, in particular cereals (gluten) and the increasing complexity of cooking recipes.

We are the despicable descendants of this original sin whose mechanisms are explained in detail in the *Essay on the theory of metasexuality* as well as the *Garden of Earthly Delights*, from the same blessed author. **Disconnected** men, in reaction to existential anxieties whose causes they cannot know, look for scapegoats, especially in front of relationships that do not fit at all with the social needs of the majority: this explains the incest taboo.

```quote {author="Sturgeon" cite="If all men were brothers, would you let me marry your sister ?"}
There’s a theory that certain normal habit patterns should be allowed to run their course. Take the sucking reflex, for example. [...](#).
It has been said that infants who have been weaned too early plague themselves all their lives with oral activity—chewing on straws, smoking intoxicants in pipes, drinking out of bottle by preference, nervously manipulating the lips, and so on. With that as an analogy, you may look again at the restlessness of mankind all through his history. 
```

This culture and social system regulating our every move and thoughts, is made by and for a majority which lost access to the most important part of reality, and depend on social conventions to hide this unshakable sense of doubt and discomfort, this existential pain. On the contrary, our natural lifestyle should pretty much imitate Chimpanzees, with the caveat of a much longer lifespan, a total control of fertility and possibly a good handle on the productive capabilities of the environment.

Whether male animals are capable of innately recognizing their offspring is debated, but specific cases are acknowledged in vertebrates. There are plenty of reasons for kin detection to be selected upon, and in most likelihood to some degree all modestly intelligent species use a variety of cues from smell to facial traits, while a lot more inferior ones rely on smell.

[Male chimpanzees](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/11/161109112334.htm "Male chimpanzees can be players and good fathers (2016)") do seem to have a clue whom they father, a fact which baffles scientists it would fly in the face of their nice theories of females using matriarchy as a means to fool them and force them to care for all kids, reduce violence, etc. Truth is scientists have a hard time understanding why an animal would care for a child he knows is **not** related at all, so that not even the ["egoist" gene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene-centered_view_of_evolution "Gene-centered view of evolution - Wikipedia") could easily explain that away.

Truth is, they can't conceive love as transcending egoist breeding concerns in species lacking our capacity for abstraction and the conscious identification to the whole species, or at least broader circles of relatedness than the immediate family (I doubt anyone could tell apart even a cousin from a random person of the same race...).

In historical or ethnographic annals, the role of fathers is very variable. Some cultures discarded it completely, others (like Romans ?) accorded fathers a much bigger role than mothers. Overall, the first aligned with "matriarchies", the latter with "patriarchies", but prosperous societies ignored neither. Our position circumvents historical analysis, as always we prefer genetics-based arguments and contemporary experiences.
 * The natural size of raw human groups is rather small, a hundred persons at most, more like 50, with which intimate meaningful relationships on a personal basis can be established, mostly with those we grew amongst. Given a few generations, the level of relatedness grows steadily.
 * We determined how our species evolved to take advantage of that consanguinity to further and accelerate its adaptation. It is in our advantage to know who are siblings, especially older ones susceptible to drift away from the mother after a few years, keeping potentially lifelong kinship networks despite halphazard group separations and fusions.

Or not at all in fact, since several higher mammals do practice allonursing, reciprocally swapping infants to breastfeed, including [giraffes](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S000334721500439X "Stealing milk by young and reciprocal mothers: high incidence of allonursing in giraffes, Giraffa camelopardalis (2016)"), [seals](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10164-006-0001-4 "Alloparenting in Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus): correlations with misdirected care and other observations (2006)") of all kinds, [meerkats](https://academic.oup.com/beheco/article-abstract/26/3/697/233775) and [ape mothers](https://www.doi.org/10.1038/srep06306 "Low costs of allonursing in meerkats: mitigation by behavioral change? (2015)") **do swap infants to breastfeed** to varying degrees so an absolutely specific mother-child bond isn't actually really a biological necessity for higher species.

But I believe both energetic link and attachment born [from blood](incest#so-why-such-a-taboo) (chimpanzees bond with their offspring for life, "about a third of adult males are essentially best friends with their mothers" [according to recent studies](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/why-chimpanzee-moms-are-so-much-like-our-own "Chimpanzee moms are like us: They mourn, dote, and take 'me' time. (2021)")) and later on with humans the need for efficient incest might be said to constitute a counter-acting evolutive pressure. Ultimately, the persistence of father-daughter incests among [GSA stories](https://marriage-equality.blogspot.com/p/case-studies.html#:~:text=Adults%20With%20Their%20Parents "Case studies, Adults With Their Parents -- Full Mariage Equality") convinced me. If the phenomena akin to  animal kin recognition applies to fathers and daughters separated at birth then cases then  then said partners who were separated at birth can indeed recognize each others immediately.

### The religion of blood {#Persia}

It has been known since classical Ancient Greece (around 500 BC) to mate and breed with their relatives, priests, until they decided to convert every single Persian. The very essence of religion is incest: it is the first and foremost good deed to accomplish, the most miraculous above all else, and that by which one converts to **Zoroastrianism**[^first_deed].
It seems that while incest wasn't uncommon before the Sassanid period not everyone agreed to the transition to a new religion be described an self-proclaimed, unrestrained, obsessive State-mandated inbreeding worship hell-bent at converting the people to daily orgasms in their female relatives, basically pushing what was before *mandatary of priests* in the Achaemenid period[^according] onto everyone, ultimately the entire world.

Incestuous intercourse had the same value regardless of age[^no_matter_age], though whether that includes prepubescent children is not clear, as nowhere did I find mention of an age limit for sexuality. Consanguineous coitus was believed to have a magical power to destroy all demons and improve the physical reality through its unseen metaphysical counterpart, from which good harvests, good rulership and good fortune overall would ensue. If everyone was to do it, the world would advance that much faster toward its ultimate regeneration at the end of time and the disparition of evil.

Not everyone were on board immediately as the texts kept memory of this conflict, hinting at quite turmoils indeed[^turmoils][^shame]. But priests pressed on unashamed and succeeded. The purpose after all, was nothing less than the salvation of the individual, the community and all of humanity forever and ever[^salvation].

The very few religious texts remaining kept a memory of this conflict. But priests pressed on unashamed and succeeded. The purpose after all, was nothing less than *transcendence, the salvation of the individual, the community and all of humanity forever and ever*:

```quote{cite="[On a Possible Lack of Incest Regulations in Old Iran](https://www.jstor.org/stable/662899)", author="J. S. Slotkin"}
The closest relative is the one who will allow him to remain himself since he is of the same flesh. *Free of any crossbreeding, the offspring enjoys the vitality of the first man*. The practice is sublimated to what seems to be the height of beauty: *the union of a man with the daughter he had from his own mother*

The xwēdōdah would be an attempt to *escape time either to stop it and rewind it*, or to accelerate the end of the world.
{.hint .info}
```
They had high moral standards at war, remarquable art, and a highly balanced, aesthetic way of life (similar to Egyptians). We learn that in xvētōdah having children, however desirable, is not exactly the purpose nor a requirement: the sex itself is crucial whether people agreed with it or not[^shame], and has the same power past the age of fertility... or before, as I found no indication of any age limit, but the opposite[^no_matter_age].

As evidences:
* Four intercourses is enough to eschew any risk of going to hell regardless of any later atrocities[^heaven].
* Maintaining such marriage for 3 years ensures at least one of the three lower places of heaven, while 4 years of marriage ensures going to Garodman, the highest station of heaven, closest to God.
* It is always the most meritorious deed, for non-believers and believers alike, and  the only way by which one converts:
	> [8.c.2](#) And of all those [four good deeds](#) he who practices xvēdōdah is greatest and best and foremost.
	> [8.f.2](#) Ohrmazd said: "Much thought, speech and action, then, is prescribed by me, ô Zardust; of that thought, speech and action which must be thought, spoken and done, *that is best and most excellent him who performs xvētōdah*.
  The text goes so far as to that providing for the livelihood of priests **is less nothing in comparison of incest**:
  > When he maintains (xvētōdah) in marriage for three years, thus *(it is) as though all this world, with water, with plants and with everything, have been given as aid to a priest*.

The essence of religion itself, as stated several times, was incest, as though zoroastrianism had the concept of indivual souls, as one big family the fate of the community in this life and the hereafter, was intrinsically linked to the individual. As a result, consent in marriage normally indispensable could be eschewed in the case of xvētōdah[^consent]. In the case of incest marrying a daughter by force (assumedly to oneself) is no problem[^bad_translation].

Marriage was *mandatory* but had very little to do with love: its purpose was to encourage breeding to secure the family's descent, thus the integration of the individual in the social fabric, and securing the caste system's stability. Everything was done to entice people into having children and taking pleasure in it... But if that wasn't an option, adopting was equally commendable.

**Paying** someone to have incest sex was as meritorious as doing it oneself: nothing mattered more than the sex itself, not the intent or sentiments[^REA], as it kept its magical, ritualistic value regardless of the situation. Consequently, this legal leeway seemingly encouraged rich people to provide financially for poor people for their marriage.

Lastly **the refusal to have sex with a daughter and so delay her marriage[^promise] constituted a grievous sin**, amounting to refusing her entry to heaven. According to the text, **xvētōdah grants great pleasure and joy in life**, **mutual satisfaction in sex**, a stronger family unit even in old age and in front of health issues, and an eight-fold increase in the children' affection.

This much is corroborated by modern accounts.
{.important}

A racist State must embrace incest, and make it mandatory, The religion of blood, in and of itself, has the potential to bring satisfaction to every child, man and woman. Fathers should sleep with their daughters again and again, satisfying one another endlessly, purifying the race and generating enough magical power to run an entire city for the day, and providing the State with entire battalions of pure prescient SS soldiers.

If a significant number of families could experience love with the intensity pointed out by this GSA phenomenon, the world as we know it with its wars, artificial ideologies and activities compensating for our inner emptiness - our Pascalian diversions - _**would explode into pieces**_.

	The pattern of mating range must diminish as the group allows procreation between more closely related individuals so that harmful recessives are rapidly reduced. The most damaging breeding strategy is one that is inconsistent.

	If a population fluctuates erratically from inbreeding to exogamy, it will retain and accumulate deleterious recessives in heterozygous form during inbreeding and expose them when the pattern shifts to inbreeding.
	{.important}

	However, an inbred population that is constantly reproducing will experience an increase in unhealthy homozygotes only temporarily, until its genetic load is reduced.

	This principle of consistency also explains why sporadic inbreeding in large outbred populations (with inherently large genetic loads) results in a higher rate of genetic disease.

	* Among the Ba-Ila, nothing is more monstrous and dreaded than incest, but he who wants to succeed in a difficult undertaking commits it with his sister: “It gives great strength to his talisman. »
	* The Thonga who wants to hunt the hippopotamus unites sexually with his daughter. He immediately becomes a "murderer", but he now has *the power to accomplish "great things on the river"*.
	* In a tribe around Lake Nyassa, incest with the mother or sister *makes whoever dares it invulnerable to bullets*.

	By violating the holiest law, man has acquired *the dangerous co-operation of supernatural forces*, a bit like becoming a sorcerer, one must elsewhere sign a pact with the devil. *By incest, the daring one has precisely transformed into a sorcerer, but for a limited time, for the success of a definite enterprise*. He had to ritually brave the dangers of sacrilege to put himself beyond the reach of profane risks.
	It literally only takes a *conversion obtained by suitable penance*, a change of direction facilitated by the required practices or attitude, *so that the sinister power* shown by the transgressor of the sacred rules *is found intact and reversed* when it comes to maintaining them and enforcing them. Thus the great pontiff P. Licinius, known as Livy, arrested C. Flaccus to make him a flame of Jupiter, “***because*** of his turbulent and debauched youth”; and the latter, previously hated by his parents for his vices, was so transformed by his consecration that he restored the sanctity of his priesthood, compromised by his predecessors.
	Similarly, if in Christian hagiography, the greatest sinners, including the greatest saints, it is not only in order to edify the faithful on the omnipotence of divine grace, it is also by the effect of this postponement, always possible in the order of blessings, *exceptional resources manifested by the enormity of faults*.

	This last remark applies perfectly to the case of Cato the Younger who, conforming to a tradition that Plutarch makes up to King Numa, divorced his fertile Marcia to "lend" to his friend Hortensius. It also applies to the case of the Nasamon husband who "lends" the young married wife to the guests of the meal. On the other hand, the desire to individualize paternity, despite the sexual differences, found in the Bretons or the machlyes, testifies to a form of recognition of the conjugal family. [P42](#)

[^shame]:
	Shame and disagreements did not cease completely, explaining perhaps why they went to such lengths to expound the qualities and benefits of xvētōdah... to convince themselves perhaps. Far from denying the naturality of incest though, this kind of ambivalence simply illustrates the effects of molecular disturbances in the brain warping behaviors causing [Excalibur impulses](meta#excalibur) to emerge.
	```quote{cite="Courte réflexion sur l'inceste à l'iranienne (translated)"}
	The seventh book of the Dēnkard mentions the shame that can be felt when practicing such a union, and the Zurvanist conception keeps the memory that this type of alliance **awakens negative forces**. Incestuous practice was, it seems, **amphipolar in the eyes of some**. **Producing knowledge**, it was supposed to **bring to light supernatural forces, feared and desired**.

	The closest relative is the one who will allow him to remain himself since he is of the same flesh. *Free of any crossbreeding, the offspring enjoys the vitality of the first man*. The practice is sublimated to what seems to be the height of beauty: *the union of a man with the daughter he had from his own mother*

	The xwēdōdah would be an attempt to *escape time either to stop it and rewind it*, or to accelerate the end of the world.

[Westermarck hypothesis]: DFN "The Westermarck effect, also known as reverse sexual imprinting, is a psychological hypothesis that states that people tend not to be attracted to peers with whom they lived like siblings before age six. This hypothesis was first proposed by Finnish anthropologist Edvard Westermarck in his book The History of Human Marriage (1891) as one explanation for the incest taboo."

	The closest genetic and phylogenetic kin we have, chimpanzees and bonobos, currently live in sub-Saharan Africa in small comparatively inbred troops and as such they maintain, though with numbers in at best a few hundred thousand, **perhaps three times more genetic diversity than our species simply among the three varieties of chimpanzees** let alone the bonobos, which suggests **small, reproductively isolated demes**.

	Inbreeding among chimpanzees is limited by the dispersal of female juveniles but by no means eliminated, and bonobo females like langurs are less likely to disperse (with langurs, the males disperse, with bonobos, some females rise to dominant status, often dominating their sons on into adulthood). Moreover among chimpanzees, the dominant male and other males play no role in infant care, so **we should not expect some Westermarck familiarity effect to inhibit father/daughter inbreeding**.

	However, we found **multiple, non-mutually exclusive potential factors that may influence the decision by females to remain in their natal group**: a decrease in indirect feeding competition, support from mothers or allomothers in the care of offspring and in aggressive interactions with other individuals, close relationships with the other remaining females, and a short adolescent infertility period. Additionally, we observed a natal female copulating with her older brother, which was **the first observation of brother–sister incest in Mahale**. Although DNA analysis revealed that her infant was not a product of inbreeding, the pair copulated frequently in the latter half of her estrus period, suggesting that they did not avoid incest behaviorally to avoid inbreeding.

	Furthermore, there was no hard evidence that the remaining female avoided mating with her maternal brother, suggesting that **incest avoidance may not be a proximate factor responsible for female dispersal**.

	[29](#) There is one thing, however, that I forgot to say about Oedipus: He did not go to Delphi to consult the oracle but fell in with Teiresias​and suffered great calamities from that seer's divination on account of his own ignorance. For he knew that he had consorted with his own mother and that he had children by her; and subsequently, when perhaps he should have concealed this or made it legal in Thebes, in the first place he let everybody know the fact and then became greatly wrought up, lifted up his voice and complained that he was father and brother at once of the same children, and husband and son of the same woman.
	[30](#) But domestic fowls do not object to such relation­ships, nor dogs, nor any ass, nor do the Persians, although they pass for the aristocracy of Asia.

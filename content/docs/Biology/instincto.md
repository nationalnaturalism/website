The dietary method named instinctotherapy (or instinctive paleolithic diet) which arose from our research, consists of the integral return to raw foods regulated by our dietary instinct that all animals possess, but that cultural habits systematically inhibit and repress. Experiences on thousands of people showed consequences to be so numerous and far-reaching, that the recent advent of cooking in prehistory can be likened to the Fall in Genesis, and the mythology of many cultures around the world, such the Greek myth of the 5 races and [egyptian scriptures](https://www.gigalresearch.com/uk/publications-pharaohs.php "Egypt before the pharaohs - Gigal Research").

## What is an instinctive diet

### Denatured molecules

After decades of observation of thousands of people, it has become clear that cooking is responsible for most bacterial, viral and degenerative diseases. In fact our very understanding of disease is wrong, as represented by the fallacious Germ theory whose own creator understood that the terrain of the body is what plays a crucial role in the progress of disease.
However, with a certain amount of food discipline and a fairly broad range of healthy foods, **a very strict discipline and obedience to the sense of smell** (letting the body determine its needs), we can use our body as it was meant, once again.

It is possible to awaken our eating instinct, which all animals have, and bring about **the near complete elimination of disease**, especially as a life-threatening phenomena. Strength, agility, recovery time, mental acuity, all stats improve samewise on their own, fairly quickly, in proportion to the quality of your diet (and secondarily of your genetics). Access to the food range as close as can be to that of the great apes (whose needs are near-identical to our own) also proved absolutely essential.

The main reason is the [AGE](ABBR "Advanced Glycation Endproducts")s (and [ALE](ABBR "Advanced Lypation Endproducts") for lipids) are classes of very specific molecules, thousands of times more abundant in cooked food and associated with disorders as varied as cancer, [diabetes](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11892-013-0453-1 "Vlassara, H., Uribarri, J. Advanced Glycation End Products (AGE) and Diabetes: Cause, Effect, or Both? (2014)"), [organ failure](https://doi.org/10.1155/2019/2746521 "Excessive Oxidative Stress Contributes to Increased Acute ER Stress Kidney Injury in Aged Mice (2019)"), cognitive decline [with](https://doi.org/10.1007/s007020050069 "Alzheimer's disease – synergistic effects of glucose deficit, oxidative stress and advanced glycation endproducts (1998)") and [without](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mad.2011.10.007 "Serum concentration of an inflammatory glycotoxin, methylglyoxal, is associated with increased cognitive decline in elderly individuals (2011)") Alzeimer disease, with genetics markedly **playing no role**. AGEs are the results of a chaotic blending of sugar chains and proteins and we know of their [key role](https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/3818196 "Advanced Glycation End Products (AGEs): Biochemistry, Signaling, Analytical Methods, and Epigenetic Effects (2020)") in inflammations (making for a much higher pain sensibility in humans than in wild animals), and last but not least the aging process.
{#near-elimination}

Detecting, quantifying and studying AGEs in live subjects, has only been possible [very recently](https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/3818196 "Advanced Glycation End Products (AGEs): Biochemistry, Signaling, Analytical Methods, and Epigenetic Effects (2020)"), though precision sufficient for really conclusive studies still require mass spectrometry for the simple reason that it is the only way to study molecules whose structure we just don't precisely. And considering their untold diversity, low concentration and possible intracellular location, the need for a bulky (and expensive) device such as a mass spectrometer definitely hinders the understanding of AGEs, their role and ubiquity... *supposing scientists had the drive to invest in this research in the first place*.
So we see that the study of AGE, even the means for it, still hasn't grown out of its diapers.

These molecules are **produced during cooking at a rate exceeding several thousands times, if not more, than what is found in nature** (outside forest fires of course, though they usually burn trees to a crisp instead of cooking them). Yet despite several findings indicating their major role in health, nothing even remotely of a corresponding scale was undertaken to curtail the issue. Even the bloodiest dictator could never fight against his people's habit of cooking...
We will see what consequences this constant chemical onslaught has been tampering with the brain and disrupting its higher functions for tens of millenia (increasingly so), twisting the development of culture since then. we will also see the omnipresent effects on health in general, creating what is in effect is a false, feeble human condition, **a _fallen_ nature**.

But first, we shall define what exactly is the natural diet, by example, before going through the numerous changes that occur, how it truly sets correct rawpaleodiet practitioners apart from the rest of humanity.

### Criteria for a natural diet

![Illustration of our original food range](/Images/images_article_instincto/illustration_instincto.webp "The answer is to observe wild animals, to discover our original food range")
{.center}

- They feed only on raw food, neither mixed nor processed or seasoned
- They are guided mainly by smell and only then by sight, color or memory.
Under optimal conditions the following pattern invariably applies:
attractive smell → salivation reflex = physiological need → <q>luminous phase</q>, an excellence in taste confirming the smell.
- Saturation of need is indicated by an unpleasant sensation in the mouth: acidic, bitter, raspy, difficult swallowing etc, meaning that enzymes are missing.
- Forcing us to stop eating, as continuing regardless causes a painful sensation in the stomach, if not immediately the mouth.

Some food have a stronger character than others for instance pineapple (that contain a protease) will make you **bleed** from the moment your body stops producing anti-proteases. This doesn't mean pineapples are inherently <q>better</q> though, all wild food can become unimaginably repulsive to the point of throwing up.

The wideness of tastes they can take depending on your inner state, is a crucial characteristic of wild food compared to domesticated or selected species - which can't be as rich in taste nor as harrowingly distasteful when the body refuses it. Just bland in comparison. It is a dialogue, an active exchange, like talking but in the primeval common language of chemistry and maybe more. Ultimately the level of delight we can attain, exceed by far anything cooking can invent: in fact it only ever tricks our taste buds, **playing on a few strings discordantly while a original taste is a symphony in comparison**.

(**Wild**) animals do not have our intellect, they spontaneously obey their senses to regulate the quantities. Too dumb to disobey nature. Influenced neither by dietetics nor the fear of missing, a good smell is followed by a good taste, they continue to eat, stop at the first sensation less pleasurable. It must be understood that metabolic needs evolve slowly therefore kept very close to those of our ape cousins. Wikipedia says for [bonobos](.#places).

**Precise menu content:**
- Fruits (pulp + seeds) > 50 % weight
- Other important plant foods: stem pith, leaves, petioles, seeds, flowers
- Beetles, bees, butterflies, snakes, shrews, earthworms, millipedes
- Sometimes small mammals, up to young antelopes. Or smaller monkeys.

We find that monkeys (like bears and many omnivorous animals) to be very opportunistic. They show clear preferences but the most important seems to have varied food in 4 categories: carbohydrates (fruits, honey), vegetables (<q>greeneries</q> !), animal proteins, vegetable proteins. Depending on local availability, it is possible to rely on honey or a small variety of fruits... for a limited time.

### The importance of insects

In practice, the proteins constitute ~ 15 to 20 % of our intake in weight. Insects have revealed in fifty years of experience to become over time, for people practicing assiduously this diet, the most appreciated proteins to our gustative buds, much more than meat and eggs or fish.

Seafood (crustaceans and bivalves) are phylogenetically close to insects and thus therefore very far from us, while meat (especially mammalian) has molecular structures close to ours, therefore more likely to mislead the immune system, at least in the presence of excess quantities. More simply, even for a long-time practitioner with a relatively regenerated body and sense of taste, wild meat has as woefully or wonderfully strong a taste and stops you **very** quickly: That means we are not made to eat a lot of meat.

The irreplaceability of insects is also understood by their easy access in nature, which makes our adaptation to them an evolutionary and logical necessity.

Walk through a virgin forest like the Białowieża Forest in Poland and you will see the ground littered with huge dead tree trunks, swarming with worms and insects. **In a climate supposedly cold and inhospitable for a naked monkey !** So in a tropical climate, without human deforestation, abundance is a certainty and the primitive tribes of the New World know it well.

![Picture of giant weta, the biggest insect in the world](/Images/images_article_instincto/bandeau_weta_geant.webp "**From South Asia, a whole industry could spread to the world**")
{.center}

The larvae of barbels are found - in Europe! - inside oaks, beeches, ashes, willows, chestnut trees, apple trees, lime trees. Insect eating is not very developed in Europe (probably because of the omnipresence of dairy), creating a rather important lack in our practice of instincto. I am convinced much more positive effects could have been observed during these years otherwise.
*Excesses of beef and other farmed animals could have been avoided*, instead they caused a few cancers among those who settled in <q>carnivorism</q> in the wake of our first mistakes: Guy‑Claude's wife died in the early 1990s from eating resolutely against the very principles of the diet, eating a truly immense quantity of fat and meat, for psychological reasons which would require a book in and of themselves !

### Hunting and meat

In this sense vegetarians are right: eating animals regularly is not natural **for a primate** and the health effects are very damaging. Observations indicate monkeys have a clear preference for eggs and invertebrates, followed by reptiles and birds. I suggest you take a good look at these charts, which speak for themselves. How not to deduce the consequences could be anything but immense ?

Besides, I must stress out how chimpanzees get most of their meat not from hunting, but already dead animals. Yes, dead, rotting corpses. Which were all the rage in Roman times, so I don't think there is much danger about them, except under conditions of an extreme degenerate industrial diet like today's. The preference for stale or <q>rotten</q> (for our standards) meat was universal in primitive societies, up to the Middle Age, and for excellent reasons.
Victor de l'Avéron, a wild child found at the age of 12 in 1785 by Dr. Itard, naked and unable to speak, could spring like a gazelle, catch birds in flight as a cat would and pluck them in an instant. Compared to mammoth hunting, which presupposes organization and an elaborated use of tools, ask yourself which activity has had the most chance to mark our genetics! Prehistoric humans ate more birds and eggs and shellfish than mammals.

Vegans refuse insects and eggs assimilated to animal exploitation, banning themselves even honey, labeled <q>bee vomit</q>!
Obviously there is an element of intuitively perceived danger, as it was the case for Pythagoras, {{% expurged %}}and Hitler,{{% /expurged %}}avoiding meat. Not to mention the ecological damage of hunting and farming. And the ethical problems of this industry.

- ![chicks being slaughtered](/Images/images_article_instincto/chicks-are-pictured-in340-million-.webp)
{.center}
 
An objective point of view would take into account the practices of monkeys, consuming animal proteins in non-negligible though very limited quantities. Man is not above the general laws imposed by his biological data, which even the most fanatical vegans as inveterate carnivores (zero carb) must obey lest not suffer illness and death.
*Total* deprivation of meat causes deficiencies, which explains why vegans always make exceptions for meat, or end up so thin as to look like Auschwitz survivors.

In nature, monkeys of our lineage or in general are not carnivores like lions or dogs, jumping on the prey and gobbling it up alive, fresh. Eating fresh meat is not strictly impossible (especially the entrails and brain, of course). But it is noticeable that all populations eating raw prefer aged or downright rotten meat, like the <q>Inuits</q>.

```quote{cite="Roué, 1996" .aside}
Some people put meat and fat in a plastic garbage bag, in order to quickly get the fermentation traditionally taking place in a bag through the skin of the sewn animal. The meat is also placed in a large plastic tub with a lid, which is then kept warm in the kitchen.
```

![Complete_inuit_food_table](/Images//biology/inuit_complet.webp)

The maturation of a product (typically meat, but this applies to fruit) is typically separated into autolysis and ripening (or rotting for fruit). Aseptic autolysis is the rupture or degradation of cell membranes and cell walls, through programmed cell death, without the action of bacteria. Degradation by bacteria means rotting. The processes are not totally distinct as they occur simultaneously: in mammals, certain bacteria are transferred from the mother to the child, the same bacteria which after death and the cessation of regulation by the immune system, are responsible for the onset of putrefaction.

The online encyclopedia *Gastronomiac* defines ripening as follows:
> Operation that consists in leaving a game animal in a cool place for a variable period of time (up to 8 days, and even more for some amateurs) in order to tenderize its flesh and obtain a particular flavor under the effect of mortification. This aroma is produced by germs in the intestine, which invade the tissues and break down the proteins, producing substances which, in the long run, become toxic. Mushrooms are also involved in the practice of dry curing, where they form a kind of hard green crust on the outside of the piece of meat: they actually help the enzymes in meat tenderizing and add flavor. This crust is then removed.

We no longer push aging to the point of <q>altering the scent</q> as Montagne advocated in the 16th century, until the 19th century when Brillat-Savarin, the inventor of the eponymous cheese, is said to have said that he <q>bothered all his colleagues with the smell of the game he brought in his pockets to have it aged</q>.

![bidonville2](/Images/images_article_instincto/bidonville-sacs-plastique-emballages-alimentaires-autres.webp)

![bidonville3](/Images/images_article_instincto/bidonville-de-delhi-un-ocean-de-plastique.webp)

This is almost impossible today, and perhaps not without reason:
Foreigners eating for the first time in developing countries often get "turista", an explosive intestinal reaction to inferior food "hygiene" conditions. This is a way of saying that the intestinal flora has been disturbed and must take a few days to change and adapt.

Our advanced industrial populations live in almost total asepsis, compared to poor countries. The image of Indian children living in slums for years is well known... Even if these countries suffer from epidemics that have long since disappeared in Europe, the immune resistance of these people, exposed all their lives to various germs, vastly exceeds ours.

It is no exaggeration to say that Westerners live on a permanent drip-feed of medicine, and without it infant mortality would immediately skyrocket while life expectancy would stop at 40 years. The time for a new cleaner generation could be raised. 

Although monkeys can hunt incidentally, neither their dentition nor their digestive system allows them to eat and digest fresh meat. For tens of millions of years - before their brains developed sufficiently - primates remained opportunistic occasional meat eaters.

So it makes sense that we have adapted to consuming bodies found in the wild, already dead in a hot humid tropical climate thus quickly emitting a strong, attractive scent. In fact, even dogs bury their game in the ground.

So that's it for the meat. We have all the enzymes we need, we just have to let our friends and the microbes do their job.
But while some idiots find eating meat disgusting, some go the absolute opposite extreme, claiming we abandoned fruits and can't compete with other animals in climbing. Let's debunk this, shall we ? 

![bird1](/Images/images_article_instincto/oiseau_citron.webp)

![bird papaya](/Images/images_article_instincto/bird_papaya.webp)

Any farmer will tell you how hard it is to protect fruit from birds. One can legitimately ask the previous question for fruit: even if humans are decent climbers with training, can they really compete with birds or other tree species?
Apes have four opposable thumbs, not two, and the proportion of their limbs is much better suited to arboreal locomotion: the ratio of forearms to arms is greater, and the whole thing is longer than ours in relation to the rest of the body, allowing for efficient swinging. The evolution of our morphology shows a shift from an arboreal to a predominantly terrestrial lifestyle over the last three million years.

![dos_bonobo](/Images/biology/eugenics/physical_models/apes_chimpanzee_bonobo/dos_bonobo_chimpanze_nu.webp "Behold Original beauty")

But these reflections cannot determine how adept the original man was at moving through the trees. A good approximation can be reached however, by studying the 'wild children' who lived in the forest. Wild children are typically described as climbing trees to escape animals.

We are still - without doubt - adapted to ripe fruit, and often birds are adapted to other fruits than us and only fall back on our agricultural products to the extent that we have greatly reduced the diversity around which these species have evolved. We have ruined nature as a whole, creating an image of scarcity and permanent shortage in a wilderness that is supposed to be abundant.

![pomme_kazah](/Images/images_article_instincto/almaty-kazakhstan-03102016-fresh-harvested-260nw-2178539441.webp "Ancestral, wild apples")

This abundance and diversity can still be seen in the Kazakh forests, inhabited by omnivorous bears with similar tastes to ours. If our European woods show few edible fruit trees, it is primarily because we stopped caring for them and living in them tens of thousands of years ago, except for some Amazonian tribes. As far as the ankle is concerned, it has been said that the human ankle is fundamentally different, preventing it from climbing trees effectively as apes do... But this has been disproved in 2013 by Venkataraman et al, proving that some African tribes that still climb trees 20-50 meters high have no special skeletal adaptation.

![Twas](/Images/images_article_instincto/twa_Hunter-gatherers-climb-trees-and-acquire-arboreal-resources-using-a-variety-of.webp)

```quote{cite="[What tree-climbing pygmies tell us about foot evolution - National-Geographic](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/what-tree-climbing-pygmies-tell-us-about-foot-evolution)"}
This is because their ankles are so extraordinarily flexible that their feet can make angles of up to 45 degrees with their shins.
This is a level of flexibility comparable to wild chimpanzees, who climb trees in the same way. They plant their soles flat against the trunk, which allows them to hold their bodies closer to the trees and reduce the energy needed to climb.
By comparison, most people can only bend their feet 15 to 20 degrees. If you or I tried to match the bending of a Twa climber, our ankles would break catastrophically and we wouldn't be walking, let alone effortlessly climbing a thick vine.
But the secret of the Twa is not in their ankles, which are *indistinguishable from others*. Instead, the team found that the Twa's flexibility comes from calf muscles (gastrocnemius) with unusually long fibers, much longer than those of the Bakiga, a group of neighboring Ugandan farmers who do not climb trees.
```

The same could apply for most so-called key differences between us highlighted every now and then. The adaptations that have taken place all appear to be slow, multiple and gradual, and almost always present to varying degrees in our cousins for millions of years already.

![comparison ankle extension between Twa people and chimps and normal folk](/Images/images_article_instincto/Twa_chimp.jpg)

This indicates that paleolithic humans were excellent climbers, and contrary to legend, vines do not make supports (sorry Tarzan), brachiation (swinging from one branch to another with the arms only, as monkeys do) as all children around the world know, is still part of our instincts. Ergo we never quit the trees completely, never really suffered the competition from other animals, which never pushed us in the Savannah to hunt big games as many claim.

We did not descend from trees and abandon them, to start hunting a good million years before our brain could grow enough to compete with much superior predators. In fact, according to some, [to be anything but a prey](https://www.amazon.com/Man-Hunted-Primates-Predators-Evolution/dp/0813339367). Fruits were and still should be the bulk of our food (even though degenerate civilized men substituted them with grains, it's still carbohydrates, not animal fat and proteins). It appears that men are still quite good at [moving quickly from branches to branches (brachiation)](https://www.evolvemoveplay.com/movement-inspiration-8-14-14-brachiation/), with a little bit of training.

### Alcohol and sugar addiction

#### Drunken mammals

Constantly news media relate stories of drunk animals, with the obvious intent to clear our conscience, ascribing our addiction to alcohol not to people being utter degenerates (who would survive a week in the wild) but accusing nature itself of having made us potential drunkards. There could not be a better copout strategy than finding drunk animals.
Even if half those cases are fake and the remaining highly misleading, we will show it. It wouldn't even warrant my time writing this, if a number of scientists too had not been called to accredit those myths.

The problem is similar to that of drugs or other natural psychotropic/psychogenic substances. It can be summed up in 3 points:
1. Does it exist in *wild* nature in a concentration great enough to produce any physiological effect ?
2. If so, are animals instinctively guarded against too high a concentration ?
3. Can they acquire a preference for it, if so in what conditions ?

Very weak concentrations of alcohol, compared to even beers, arise as a natural product of sugar fermentation in fruits, nectar or sap. But science is definitive on this topic: the quantity is not enough to be a danger. Obviously that will depend on several factors, not just dietary availability (with primates, the amount of fruits rotting on the ground), but the composition of said fermented/alcoholic food in the animal's diet, and its metabolic rate. By virtue of natural selection, animals routinely eating a big proportion of sugar (especially if susceptible to ferment) will have a bigger liver relative to their size, and higher levels of Alcohol Dehydrogenases (ADH), the enzymes responsible for breaking down ethanol.

And the physiological tolerance to alcohol concentration in our blood also differs, so that only experimental results can decide what does or not cause ebriety. And observation in relatively health rainforests does show that the species consumming high amounts of fermented nectar or yeast do exist but show no sign of intoxication. Similarly inducing alcohol dependence on ape has proven very difficult: they do **not** like it, neither the taste nor the effect it has on them, and only drink it when forced by circumstances.

One can theorize without too much difficulty, that exposition of the cocktail of thousands of new chemical compounds each cooking recipes magnifies reward circuits a hundred times, creating evolutionary counter-intuitive though a powerful dependency neurologically identical to that of drugs[^drugs]. Unsurprisingly this finding raised a whole lot of controversies, since it amounts to calling nearly everyone liking sweets a druggie[^absurd]. Except that people very high on industrial sugar absolutely match the description. This kind of criticism smells a lot like a defense mechanism to me ! How on Earth does the relative peace of getting one's dose at regular intervals proving that it's not a drug ? People are addicted to tobacco and it doesn't seem to alter their personality *but only as long as they can smoke*[^smoke].

Cooking as a whole appears much harder to withdraw from than mere just white sugar (or saccharine). It may be essentially socio-psychological *- arguably ? -* but to master the will to forgo all recipes and follow one's instinct is more difficult than to stop drinking or smoking, one paar with cocaine addiction. As for the preference for *natural* sources of alcohol *in the wild*, no study was ever conducted.

Studies of inborn preference of alcohol in the wild for higher vertebrates are *absent*. We do have a study about chimpanzees in the wild but with proper alcohol, and not in a form we could possibly ever evolve to regulate. Fermented fruits lie on the ground every now and then. *Fermented sap on the other hand lies outside the range of what could occur in nature*[](www.doi.org/10.1098/rsos.150150 "Tools to tipple: ethanol ingestion by wild chimpanzees using leaf-sponges (2015)"), and requires a human artifice to brew. Chimpanzees drink sap from the tree, never brewing for a minute, let alone a week. A minute of reasoning should suffice to realize that evolution was in no way required to guard us against fermented sap impossible to find in nature.

*As all forms of processing brewing is likely to bypass natural regulations*. So to assume from the behavior of <q>wild</q> chimps eating who-knows-what that the common ancestors of all primates developed an **inborn tendency for alcoholism** goes beyond stupidity, into the realm of willful deceit of public opinion.

	A well-known characteristic of addictive drugs is their ability to cause repeated, intermittent increases in extracellular dopamine (DA) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). We find that rats with intermittent access to sugar will drink in a binge-like manner that releases DA in the NAc each time, like the classic effect of most substances of abuse. This consequently leads to changes in the expression or availability of DA receptors.
	Intermittent sugar access also acts by way of opioids in the brain. There are changes in opioid systems such as decreased enkephalin mRNA expression in the accumbens (Spangler et al., 2004). Signs of withdrawal seem to be largely due to the opioid modifications since withdrawal can be obtained with the opioid antagonist naloxone. Food deprivation is also sufficient to precipitate opiate-like withdrawal signs.

	> Tom Sanders, emeritus professor of nutrition and dietetics at King’s College London said that it was “absurd to suggest that sugar is addictive like hard drugs.”
	> While it is true that a liking for sweet things can be habit-forming it is not addictive like opiates or cocaine, said Sanders. Individuals do not get withdrawal symptoms when they cut sugar intake.

	```quote{cite="2008, Chronic intake of fermented floral nectar by wild treeshrews"}
	We discovered that seven mammalian species in a West Malaysian rainforest consume alcoholic nectar daily from flower buds of the bertam palm (Eugeissona tristis), which they pollinate. The 3.8% maximum alcohol concentration (mean: 0.6%; median: 0.5%) that we recorded is among the highest ever reported in a natural food.
	Nectar high in alcohol is facilitated by specialized flower buds that harbor a fermenting yeast community, including several species new to science. Pentailed treeshrews (Ptilocercus lowii) frequently consume alcohol doses from the inflorescences that would intoxicate humans. *Yet, the flower-visiting mammals showed no signs of intoxication*. Analysis of an alcohol metabolite (ethyl glucuronide) in their hair yielded concentrations higher than those in humans with similarly high alcohol intake.

[^voluntary]:
	```quote{cite="1972, Voluntary Alcohol Consumption in Apes" .aside}
	While experimental approaches aimed at producing alcohol addiction must be carried out with nonhuman subjects, evidence from animal studies has indicated that it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to produce an <q>alcoholic</q> animal in the sense in which the term is applied to man. It should be noted that there are some very real differences between the usual alcohol-drinking behavior observed in human beings and the reported instances of alcohol intake in other species.
	It is true that nonhuman animals have been induced to drink solutions containing alcohol and to become intoxicated (Lester, 1966). The inducements have, however, been rather drastic. *For example, animals deprived of water for many hours develop extreme thirst which forces them to tolerate alcohol solutions. Similarly, animals deprived of food for long periods of time have been observed to consume solutions containing alcohol, presumably for caloric value* (Malmo, 1965). When not in need of food or water, however, animals generally avoid alcohol.
	```
Assuming an uncontrolled natural disposition for alcohol, for megafauna (animals our size or bigger) to get drunk one would require enormous amount of fermented fruits at the same place and time incompatible with any notion of instinctive regulation, so that an automatic vomitive reflex would kick in before the alcohol level could rise in any capacity. It is a fact that natural food almost never reaches beer-levels of ethanol, let alone degrees higher than 3%.
So in any case to argue an hypothetical taste for a 1 to 1.5% degree in food still wouldn't account for humans' addiction or taste to the likes of cider (3%) beer (4.2%) whine (5%) sake (15%) or whisky (40%). The tolerance to a certain substance selected by evolution has to reflect the conditions found in our environment, which never included anything higher than 2% at the very worst in any appreciable quantity. Therefore no evolutionary argument can explain a taste for alcohol beverage.

Only the paradoxical physiological state induced by cooking, plus the early annihilation of our dietary instinct could, plus a strong cultural psycho-cultural conditioning to do away with the inborn aversion every child experiences. That is why **captive** primates have been seen liking some level of alcohol[^level_alcohol]...
Even then, if we consider:
* The constant digestive unease cooked food brings and the alleged digestive effect of alcohol at low-level[](https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jim-2020-001436 "Effects of red wine on accelerated gastric emptying following Nissen fundoplication (2020)")[](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9989681/ "The appetizing effect of an apéritif in overweight and normal-weight humans (1999)")[](https://www.phillymag.com/be-well-philly/2017/01/10/why-alcohol-makes-you-poop/ "Why Alcohol Makes You Poop (And How to Avoid a Bathroom-Filled Morning After) (2017)"), accelerating digestion and gut mobility --- in simple words *pooping*, 
* The capacity of animals with big brains (non-human primates) to offset more immediate reactions in order to repeat a positive outcome they experienced
* the deregulation of instincts, important digestive discomfort and heavy sleep cooked food cause

Then there is no surprise those poor monkeys fed on **biscuits**, instead of seeking tipsiness simply sought the momentaneous relief from permanent intestinal discomfort and the *speeding up the expulsion of denatured molecules* that some amount of alcohol provided.
 
Secondly, the precise regulation in ethanol consumption observed might allude to a certain dose of fermentation (indicated by ethanol) being not just benign but desirable, due to us having adapted to it. Some even spontaneously form in our guts. The monkeys may have just sought to compensate for the lack of it in their lab diet.

Typically, children learn to break open aversion barriers to coffee and alcohol by masking their taste with sugar, preferring sweat beers or cider to wine. Sugar + ethanol might as well explain why people *start* drinking, the combination unconsciously reminding their body of fermented fruits.
#### Drunken birds

![birds](/Images/biology/alcohol/so_called_drunk_birds_passerine.jpg "drunken birds **run over by a car**")

Some birds have a very specialized diet, consisting mostly if not totally on fruits. So like the treeshrews, they evolved to ingest digest and excrete in a matter of *an hour* up to the equivalent of a man of 70 kg eating 14 kg at once, not even throughout the day. Their metabolism, as per the requirements of constant flight as well as thermogenesis (in both cases the smaller the less efficient energy-wise) is - as general rule - much faster than mammals', and the smaller the faster.
Hence for a given feeding/digestion time they will be in contact with a lot more alcohol per gram of body mass than would frugivores among mammals. Then those levels quickly dwindle as the ethanol (then more importantly, its toxic subproduct acetaldehyde) breaks down due to enzymes.

But do birds always cope with their diet ? Natural selection would say <q>Yes of course duh</q> but people keep reporting slews of wild birds dropping from the sky, running into windows and cars, singing on the street in groups oblivious to humans, unable to fly off. Seemingly completely hammered. And people love to report it, incriminating *fermenting berries*.

See [the New York Times, in 2018](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/07/science/drunk-birds-gilbert-minnesota.html), giving up this self-comforting popular telltale of drunken birds. Scientists have been debating for decades by now, owing to the difficulty of analyzing the lots of dead or alleged drunken birds by forensic pathologists, in order to ascertain common causes of possibly unrelated accidents. One difficulty lies in the variety of species involved[^birds].

That behavior alone, ethanol-induced stupor or not, doesn't seem normal at all. Both populations and needs should be tailored to the quantities and diversity of food, so that animals shouldn't feel any such rush, not to the point of killing themselves, when less ripe fruits exist. If for some reason in tens or hundreds of thousands of years that very parameter (availability of ripe berries) did not change, then birds would adapt to eat less ripe ones. And coevolution - birds spreading seeds by shitting them - would favor species ripening earlier or longer.
The fact it didn't happen, means that there used to be enough food so that such selection pressure couldn't increase.

In some cases some birds fall back on back on less appealing, *too fermented* berries, pushing the limit, with deadly consequences. But how much of them is highly debatable and was debated to death, as many such fallen birds have been analyzed, some autopsies demonstrating excess alcohol[^deadly], some not[^study].

It doesn't take a galaxy-brain to realize that in the past, a mere 50 years ago, urbanization in the US wasn't nearly as extensive and intensive as today. There were a lot more trees, more diverse too, the farther back in time we go. So... environmental degradation, as usual. The simplest cause, is merely overeating, due to the extreme rarity of ripe fruits in the urbanized, semi-urbanized or agricultural lands: that much was concluded by sound minds[^overeating]. Intoxication might very well occur as a consequence of overeating and excess **sugar** level, but no one ever showed that (wild) birds *prefer* fermented berries so in no way did these happenings ever help condone our alcoholism.

[^overeating]:
	```quote{author="Gary Rogue" cite="[Drunk robins: It’s a myth that those birds are drunk on berries](https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2009/12/24/gary-bogue-drunk-robins-its-a-myth-that-those-birds-are-drunk-on-berries/)"}
	Every fall, flocks of robins migrate to warmer climates to escape dropping temperatures. They use up a lot of energy and Bay Area gardens have become popular pit stops along the way. The starving birds usually stay a week or so to dine on tasty berries and worms before continuing their journey south.

	In reality, the birds are just suffering the aftereffects of a serious case of overeating. When the robins land in your yard, they are *starving*. They dive headlong into the berry bushes in a feeding frenzy, made all the more frantic by each other’s competitive actions as they fight to see who can eat the most berries in a single gulp.

	Bird life is further complicated when suddenly elevated blood sugars, from gorging on sweet berries, contribute to the avian hyperactivity. This overeating also results in top-heavy, overweight birds staggering around the sky as they try to deal with the effects of gravity on dramatically modified flight characteristics. Filled to the brim with 10 to 15 juicy berries apiece, about *20 percent of each bird’s natural weight*, they are no longer graceful fliers.
	Those *fresh, unfermented*Nonalcoholic berries are a source of nutritious food for many wild creatures. The pyracantha berry is the potato of the bird world.
	The ripening process continues from October through January, depending on subspecies of berry, air temperature, moisture, etc.
	*It is quite obvious there is a marked difference in flavor between ripe and unripe berries. I’ve seen whole flocks of robins skip over entire bushes because the berries obviously didn’t taste just right to them.*

	Several wild cedar waxwings (Bombycilla cedrorum) fell from a rooftop following ingestion of overwintered hawthorn (Crataegus Sp.) apples. At necropsy,there was pericardial hemorrhage, although no microscopic abnormalities were found. Ethanol was present in crop contents (380 ppm) and in the livers (238 and 989 ppm). The cause of death was attributed to hemorrhage following a fall precipitated by ethanol intoxication.

	A significant finding in our study is the detection of 1,000 ppm ethanol in the liver of one of nine birds, 260 ppm in two of six pools of intestinal contents, and 700 ppm from the out-of-state submission of one of two gastrointestinal pools analyzed. *Ethanol was not detected in eight livers*, in six pools of crop, and six pools of gizzard contents. In our study, the primary cause of death in the *21 birds necropsied was hepatic rupture and severe internal hemorrhage* from blunt trauma.
	In a feeding trial of Bohemian Waxwings, blood ethanol levels were found to be as high as 20 and 50 ppm, and it was suggested that *these levels are so low that they cannot be assumed to have any influence upon the bird’s flying ability and behavior*. However, Cedar Waxwings used in the study were twice as large as in our report.
	Alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) activity is high in fruit eaters and low in seed-eating birds. Prinzinger and Hakim (1996) reported that the combination of the high ADH activity and the low concentration of alcohol normally found in fermented fruits and berries means that birds have no problem in coping with alcohol. Others have estimated that, if the Waxwing ate 30 g of rowan berries in 1 h, the alcohol content in the water phase of the bird would be 0.5 %, in spite of its alcohol elimination. This high ethanol concentration might be expected to affect the bird’s ability to fly.

### Instincts should be learnt early

Bodies need no intellectual guidance from dietetics for the good reason that it knows its own needs to the second and to the milligram of substances: Many people ignore or would deny the possibility for their nose to indicate anything, or that food's scents can change from one moment to the next. They just never experienced it. It is important to realize we have been subjected to cooking since birth. Every instinct requires a concomitant learning ensuring its correct application.
Herring gulls, for example, drop hard prey from heights onto hard ground, to eat the inside, crabs for instance. Young birds up to one year old tend to fail ridiculously: catching in the air what they just dropped, dropping it on water or soft surfaces or do not fly high enough and must repeat. This contributes to the high mortality of this species’ younglings.

These feeding instinct behaviors require extremely complex cerebral motor coordination, flexibility involving an ability to learn various behavior patterns depending on prey, soil, wind, competitors. Youngsters have the instinct to try but understanding the relationship between hard surfaces, height and success takes time and often fails. Sometimes they lose interest in their prey, which is then stolen by a competitor.

```quote {author="Larousse Encyclopedia" .aside}
The monkey who did not play as a child is a social misfit. We have seen animals born in captivity and raised alone: once adults, they were not able to communicate properly with others, did not know how to find their place in the hierarchy and were unable to court females or to mate.
```

![Photograph of Konrad Lorenz](/Images/images_article_instincto/konrad-lorenz-1.webp)

In some species, such basic behavior requires a learning process. The same is true for feeding: the instincts are actualized in the key moments of childhood. This notion highlighted by Konrad Lorenz is fundamental for food and love.

Thus the very young baby in front of raw food, will immediately have the innate reflex to smell, to open its mouth if the odor is appropriate, and will turn away its head if the odor is not very engaging or even will spit it out. Many parents will attest to this. Within a few weeks, most of them show an interest in meat, and chew to extract the juice because they have no teeth. 

On the contrary, in the culinary context, an habituation born from the constraint of denatured, industrial or otherwise processed foods, compromises the baby's ability to assimilate the scale of tastes and smells in relation to inner needs. Cooked flavors change very little, because the genetic programming of senses supposes the contact of raw food. Obedience to parents and conditioning through the vintage command <q>finish your plate</q> eventually replace the baby's instincts with eating habits, dietary beliefs and a permanent inner metabolic disorder.

The child born raw (or wild animals) on the other hand gets to know his body and its subtle signals by associating pleasure to obeying natural laws and discomfort to disobeying them.

Acquiring this natural acuity of smell and proprioception during adulthood is difficult, it requires a lot of discipline, and the application of some rules developed with the years regarding the number of meals, their quantities, some hints of satisfaction or overload, etc. These are all crutches, but absolutely essential ones for all those who hail from a <q>cooked society</q>.

![First cover of Manger Vrai](/Images/biology/instinctotherapy_manger_vrai_1re_de_couverture.webp)

Maternal diet from the moment of conception to the delivery is known for certain now, to impact the child's health for its whole life[^dutch-hunger]. Even disregarding abnormal heat-related molecules, cooked food's level of vitamins can be **tens of times** lower than in raw food So by indulging in cooked food your children are robbed of a normal development, given deficiencies which may potentially not be corrected completely if said child is given raw food from day 1.

### Endogenous excitation

Nervosity outside viral episodes reduces drastically, making advanced mental cases the likes of which one finds in psy wards tolerable or totally normal depending on the syndrome and age, and making parangons of calm in whatever situation out of normal people. Glutens in particular (group of proteins specific to *true cereals*, from the Poaceae family including with all kinds of wheat) were demonstrated in clinical studies to be directly responsible for [significantly increased symptoms](https://www.10.1126.com/science.1246624) in schizophrenics, in past as well as [recent  studies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22516148/ "Increased prevalence of transglutaminase 6 antibodies in sera from schizophrenia patients (2013)"). The link between schizophrenia gluten and coeliac disease is well known[](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6247287/ "Use of a Gluten-Free Diet in Schizophrenia: A Systematic Review (2018)"), as well as the autoimmunity they provoke.

Sweetened drinks (soda, chocolate with sugar, coffee with sugars, anything with artificial sugars really) have been linked several times with dementia, brain aging, onsets of Alzeihmer and smaller brain volumes[](https://www.bu.edu/articles/2017/soda-bad-for-brain/ "Is Soda Bad for Your Brain? (And Is Diet Soda Worse?)")[](https://doi.org/10.1161/STROKEAHA.116.016027 "Sugar-and Artificially Sweetened Beverages and the Risks of Incident Stroke and Dementia (2017)")[](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jalz.2017.01.024 "Sugary beverage intake and preclinical Alzheimer's disease in the community (2017)"). 

Ten years ago I confirmed this on my person. I had nervous issues, a dissociative tendency - not to the point of losing my sanity, but just enough to cause severe depression with bulimia-anorexia and the incapacity to concentrate. The bulk of it appeared in a year, while no physician could do a thing, besides giving pills which had no effect, except low-key mimicking a lobotomy.

I had the luxury before, to see for myself what those pills could do to people, and wanted none of it so I decided to learn a new <q>diet philosophy</q> for lack of a better term, and I learnt everything else by the same occasion, in the same movement, in a spa of ten years, while my mind broadened, discarding old psychological fixations and taboos.

This lack of nervousness compared to the state of mind under a *traditional* diet cannot be envisioned save by seasoned meditation practitioners for whom the perpetual issue is to carry on [the calm of their cushion into daily life](spirituality). <q>*into the kitchen sink*</q> as the saying goes. Perhaps the worst place to start !
One really has to live it for oneself: the number of situation one feels normally overwhelmed by impressions and emotions in daily life and acting on them or thinking it's a big deal is staggering, it is a new way to go about life, that alone offers nearly for free a peaceful state of mind worth a lifetime of investment in spirituality to most of the time, little to no avail.

This relentless inner turmoil and uncontrollable urges are only chaotic dysfunctions of the brain, excited by the constant influx of denatured molecules coursing your bloodstream, now acknowledged both in their psychogenic effects.
**We called this the feedback effect**.
{.important #def_feedback_effect}

The case of common <q>excitants</q> and <q>stimulants</q> like coffee and chocolate and <q>anything with too much sugar</q> shouldn't be difficult to consider today, but what if the whole of cooked food acted similarly, arguably much worse ?
When everyone is mad, no one is seen as such !
Once that most of the **immediate feedback** effect ruining lives and causing all mental issues (save for clear genetic ones like such as Down syndrome...) subsumes in a month or two in good conditions (or more a few more for serious cases), one is then free to undertake the worse part, that is rewiring one's brain.

Because this constant mind poisoning since early babyhood actually wires our brains in a pathological paranoiac (and dissociative) mode that only a long exposure to a balanced nervous state can teach the brain how to react, what to correct. Thus the importance of steadfastness, beyond a simple matter of health:
To correct **structural feedback** one needs to see the natural state, one oneself and others, to recalibrate and remember it when we lose it for some reasons. This allows us not to invest in erroneous thoughts, emotions and situations. We learn to laugh at ourselves, and not to take ourselves too seriously.

While quickly enough the company of easily triggered normal folk, <q>cooked people</q>, becomes intolerable. We wanna get out of the cavern of shadows, and find <q>real</q> people. The same properly mind-blowing gap is starkly exemplified with animals, which do not have the luxury of that big head of ours and its wonderful though deceptive ability for self-control.
But cockerels and pigs fed with (heated) grains and leftovers, routinely attack their peers or females, leading sometimes to an orgy of violence and blood, hence the need to separate males from each other or even from females. The problem is well-known, though the association with dietary conditions, hardly so. In the same vein, niggers skullfuck and eat each others routinely in all of Africa, since time immemorial.

On the other hand, wild animals (or domestic animals not fed with $h!t !) act much more harmoniously, tolerate each other and males do not indulge in reckless fights leading to injuries. Some even grow a liking with each other when females lack... Dogs stop barking ceaselessly at the slightest leaf falling, or for no reason at all.
And cats stop hissing loudly and fighting, while trying to copulate. The list of behavior goes on and on, and their exploration and almost infinite ramifications makes for a lot of unique research in all areas, in human or animal sciences.

At the same time since less and less things manage to trigger us anymore like a diehard feminists presented with facts, the mind becomes able to approach concepts new and old without the overly gets able to encompass much more thoughts and concepts, hitherto barred from access by subconscious mental blockades, whether born from habits or childhood conditioning.

The tendency (no one claims perfection here) goes toward not a dullness of emotions, but actually a richer inner life, more in touch with deeper meanings in life and relationships, not encumbered. As molecular order is restored, cerebral functions improve and the constant fog that followed us all our life - and for many doomed their school efforts - is lifted, granting a higher clarity of mind.

Compulsive or obsessional ideas lose their strength, progressively discarded as one comes to terms with their meaninglessness. Things we were taught as <q>evil</q> or diabolical, appear not so bad or at least not a reason to kamikaze  oneself for an unseen God and his quite hypothetical houris, burn people to the stake... or send them to jail for revisionism. Negative feelings of all kinds, fade faster and do not <q>take hold</q> of us like before.

![Cartoonish description of a rapping nigger from Wyatt Mann](/Images/memes/rape_nigger_wyatt.webp)

Talking about obsession, sex becomes an entirely different affair. For men, the very nature of the sexual drive shifts from an obsessive, compulsive and very physical need for gratification - the need to jerk off - and enlarges into a more satisfying experience, leading to heighten communication between partners and a keener perception of each other's wants and desires (and ones' own !), a clearer perception of reality overall. In fact, while lacking intimacy for too long does erode one's inner peace it never constitutes a physical urgency or urgency anymore, as some autoerotism suffices on that part.

We become also increasingly aware of ourselves, notwithstanding or trespassing the barriers of our education and prejudices, or seemingly deep-rooted disgust. From the moment we consciously choose to let go of conceptions of sex and age of partners, we become spontaneously more in tune and approach the natural norms and inner states of mind described by metapsychoanalysis. No more uncontrollable erections: these only rise when the moment calls for their use. No more <q>muh dik</q> ! Men stop seeing women as walking pieces of meat. All of it, out of the <q>mere</q> nervous system's gradual re-normalization.

### Physical strength and diseases

The tolerance for mental and physical exertion skyrockets. Once we decide on a course of action, it is not unusual to continue for hours, until late in the night... or the morning, technically. Of course the need for sleep doesn't go away, though it does diminish as sleep gets both lighter and restful, depending on persons and state of supply, as with any other trait. So sleep or fatigue in general can stack up a lot, until a day later (or several) one has to clear up one's debt (hardly a healthy practice though).

Many other elements hitherto considered perpetual constants of human nature, are products of cooking, mere artifacts of our lifestyle. The idea of an intrinsic human <q>weakness</q> (which would come as a cost of a bigger brain) in comparison to animals goes up in smoke along with the susceptibility to infections and inflammations.

The rejection of the germ theory in favor of a new understanding of viral phenomena as symbiotic and beneficial for our health frees the mind and increases the capacity for regeneration, allowing us to live fully without a care in the world.

The need for nearly any medicine, save for a few cases of surgery (dentistry and accidents), is no more. In good conditions bruises and hurts, even serious, not only do not hurt at all except on the very moment of injury, but heal up several times faster than a normal person without any disinfectants, barely any care even letting dirt and whatever on the surface, just for the lulz.

[We develop a heightened healing factor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CkWmgL0k00): Impressive doesn't do justice to that kind of feat. We truly enter the realm of superhumans.

Blood clotting takes less than a minute at least for life-critical outflows. It appeared that the considered <q>normal</q> levels of pain is not natural but caused by a constant high level of autoinflammation, raging on the smallest occasion. That explains why wounds just do not hurt when let them still and the work to do its work. The body can regenerate damaged internal organs to the extent to cure almost all diseases, and slow down the degenerative part of aging to a significant degree. **We age much better, and slowly, even without training.** Samewise, the amount of flesh that is possible to regrow when still enclosed by sufficient surrounding tissues approaches the healing factor of the likes of lions, healing big wounds healed in no time nor a care in the world.

Similarly, those born or at least raised on raw food will never worry anymore about tooth decay. Wild animals with a balance diet do not develop caries, and it wasn't uncommon for people before WW2 to never have a single cavity in their entire life, simply because we started eating so much shit only with the economic boom that followed.

Those two points together make for a much higher tolerance for grueling training, while better quality muscles coming from natural proteins (insects, shellfish, wild game, nuts) ensure a more resilient body which doesn't tend to break down nearly as much: therefore we can take much more punishment to get back on feet quicker, with a **zenkai boost**. But this wasn't explored nearly as much as it should considering an even more surprising realization: **training proved useless in so far as keeping in shape is concerned**. Animals are basically born with rippling muscles and maintain them regardless of training, as long as they have good quality food: May they slacken as they please, they do not fatten.

![Parodic modification of a meme normally praising traditional gender role and cooking, to promote instead innate ape's superior strength acquired with raw food](/Images/memes/chad_traditional_food_preparing_woman.webp "**Men on the other hand, are known to lose muscles without constant exercising.**")
{.center}

Men eating cooked food that is. It appeared obvious that this was no design of ours but a degenerated state with autoimmunity plus low-quality proteins constantly breaking down our body which loses shape. With a good instincto diet, even a potato crouch will never accumulate fat but stick to a low to very low percentage though never down to a dangerous level. It doesn't mean either a loss of reserve: fasting a few days is no big deal.

It appears the body can and should regulate both the muscle and fat level to an optimal staturo-ponderal equilibrium.
{.important}

It might range from being slim to getting ripped for almost effort, depending on how long you ate traditional before and what (seasoned salads or Big Macs ?) made the transition. The more those molecules stay inside you, the longer all the processes mentioned in this text take long before acting their full power. That means people <q>born raw</q>, as we saw, do not need any exercise and develop splendid tough muscles, including girls. Therefore, a potent benefit of the raw paleo diet is to **get jacked and hot**.

And maintain that physique for much longer as well: aging slowing down, we keep a slim/athletic physique as long as we keep a varied enough diet to continue on the cleansing process, and most of all if we keep clear from excessive animal meat, especially domestic meat which proved degenerative sometimes even more raw than cooked, as less damaged molecules bypasses the immune system more and in the end cause more autoimmunity. Excess proteins do the same as unnatural proteins, and shorten lifespan, eating away at our healing factor.

The best part of our lifeforce is constantly undermined and spent on fighting off the autoimmunity caused by cooked molecules. That's why you would find no <q>prescription</q> nor medicinal drugs, nothing special to do than to follow one's instinct to a T, and certainly artificial nothing to take. While some herbs or plants may or do have special properties, they are nothing in isolation and would prove detrimental when issued out of intellectual considerations.

Infections and dangerous viral episodes become an outright impossibility and decades of experiences taught us that no genetically healthy wild animal (among vertebrates at least) that has not been polluted by denatured molecules, should be prey to microbes present in his natural environment.

**Years showed the complete eradication of infectious diseases and cancers alike** when the latter are not too advanced. Even then, it allows for a painless death with full mental faculties and no medication.
{.important}

To replace the prevailing germ theory, from the basis of our experiences and the observation of animals and the circumstances in which diseases arise, Guy‑Claude Burger created a revolutionary new theory of diseases, pathogens of all kinds (viruses, fungi, bacteria and parasites) and their relation to health.

We called this the **exogenetic command theory**, in which each layer of complexity in the realm of life, are under the genetic and molecular command of the layer above. We do not fight <q>pathogens</q>, we do not cohabit with them in a symbiotic relationships like equals in a partnership. Our genetics commands them, using them to improve the molecular order of our organisms: clean us and as well as share information in our stead.

Viruses, bacteria and multicellular parasites, at least those we meet in our natural environment (with a wide margin over "natural") serve the need of animal and vegetal species, keeping them fit and genetically strong and partaking in the horizontal transfer of genetic material throughout the whole ecosystem, as recognized today.

In this framework, the definition of life needs to be amended, as it stands to reason that the classical criteria (reproduction, metabolism - difference between the outside and inside compartment - and a response to external stimulus) do not matter in this context, as teleology (expected **purpose** within a system) information and effect. [life](DFN) should be considered as an enclosed system of information, ultimately including the whole ecosystem, air land and ocean.

There also entails profound repercussions as the theory of evolution, hinting at kinds of selective pressures acting on species or groups of them, not out of isolated elements of the natural environment but of the planet:
Since the latter could be considered as <q>alive</q> even by modern standards (tweaking them just a little) without even considering the spiritual aspect it may as well possess a <q>will</q>, expressed as the mathematical integral of all individual interactions, processed through what could be a global neural network. The purpose of this system would be (obviously) to stay alive, hence maintaining global conditions conducive to life through its own means and the agency of its constitutive parts, both biotic and abiotic.

While high-end, these speculative ideas aren't that strange nor new, and with the discovery of a reproducible source of reliable extrasensory phenomena, do come across as fairly natural, intuitive.
**What is the new though**, is the application of the virus theory as **the most ancient and prevalent means to transfer horizontally information in the form of genetic material**, across individuals and ultimately **widely across the species barrier**. Such a tool, existing since the dawn of life while not itself living (**lacking the characteristic of a metabolism**), would be the preferred means of communication inside the system, and its means to influence its components on an evolutionary scale,  much like hormones.

Such dynamics are readily apparent in our body as we known now it conveys orders to all the living cells it contains including its bacterial population (of a relative, 39 vs 30 trillions) through viruses: Human Endogenous (retro)viruses, [exosomes](viral_phenomenon#exosomes) and bacteriophages (which target viruses), helping to control microbial populations, not only by stopping their propagation but redirect, favor or extinguish species or whole genera. What if such processes were also happening on a vastly different scale, by the Earth on its denizen species ?

On a smaller scale, parasitism - and sometimes epidemics - is an undeniable fact of <q>nature</q>, even in <q>wild</q> animals (though not as much as for domesticated species, cattle etc). Epidemics indeed can be seen in the animal world, animals do fall prey to parasites, to various levels. While others don't... but still carry the pathogens ? The scientific world doesn't understand those variations of sensibility and blame genetics whenever it is convenient, to force reality into their prey-predator model generalized to all microbes, parasites, viruses, etc, like forcing a square peg into round holes.
Parasites are supremely varied and numerous, indicating either extremely successful competitors in the battle of life... or that they fill a crucial role in ecological equilibriums. Parasites are a powerful agent of natural selection on a molecular or physiological level, perhaps greatest that all other factors like predation. That is what biologists now think. This much we do not deny. **However**:
If the role of parasites and viruses is to weed out the weak and diseased, the degenerates. Keeping the population fit. The question is, how many <q>weak</q> individuals is a natural population - in a pristine natural setting - supposed to carry, what should be its **mean parasitic load** ? At what level is the balance attained ?

The answer depends on two things:
* What species are we talking about ?
* Are the parasites out for themselves and **fighting** against us, or do **we** actually control them well for our own profit, as long as we fit within the genetic and physiologic norms for a given species ?

In our experience for mammals parasites (such as tenias) are always regulated. A few days of disciplined instincto suffices to expel in mass any and all resident worms, big or small, through feces, **in animals (pets) and humans alike**. Rawpaleodiet practitioners have sojourned in African countries ridden with malaria-infected mosquitoes, none caught the disease except one - Guy‑Claude himself - **who thought smart to mix food out of frustration**. None of his twenty companions.

It appeared clear that humans could survive uniquely long with a terribly poor cooked diet. Our resilience and ability to maintain a semblance of health - something of an inner balance - seemed to have evolved further than for any other animals, including chimpanzees, who simply die with cooked fruits, in a short time.

However pets and cattle were also seen capable of gradually eliminating culinary toxins from its body, having similar though less potent mechanisms of molecular exchange when provided with equivalent natural molecules. In short, with all mammals and birds (having no experience with fish) we fed well (ensuring a varied choice not too dissimilar with what they could find on their own in the wild) ever had **any** issue with epidemics, parasites, nothing. This reality we can not deny, yet it is not the one specialists encounter in the wild.
How to explain cases like this one:
> Ommatokoita elongata is a 30 mm (1.2 in) long pinkish-white parasitic copepod, frequently found permanently attached to the corneas of the Greenland shark and Pacific sleeper shark. The parasites cause severe visual impairment,

Or the world-wide scourge of toxoplasmosis in rabbits and hare, also significantly hurting dolphins in the sea, and cats in our house. And cats' owners too. In all of these species, at least locally the disease's prevalence and loss of fitness it incurs are high (a big proportion of the population can be infected and show symptoms). Albeit less intelligent than us cats and rabbits are all highly evolved vertebrates, **sharing basically the same immune system**. This applies obviously all the more to dolphins, in some regards more evolved than us and having a similar lifespan. I believe the presence of a complex **adaptative** immune system is the key to differentiate <q>lower</q> lifeforms which tend to die whenever they are polluted (or genetically unfit) to whatever degree, quickly to be replaced by a fitter population.

Such species would need to breed very fast, in large numbers, and typically live short lives. Bacterias being a good exemple, most plants too. Individuals, in those species, do not matter one bit, and the species happily discards them for the greater good. However it seems that the more complex and adaptive the immune system is, the more a species doesn't need anymore, to discard individuals, instead their capacity to discard the source of the pollution within themselves (either metabolic waste or in our case an inordinate amount of heat-denatured molecules) grows. Ecologically, animals with higher lifespans are more likely to show advanced immune systems as losing individuals for a species (always of slow-breeders) is actually dramatic, an important blow. A species of long-lived, slow-breeders can only be maintained with rather powerful adaptive immune systems, and the ability [to maintain homeostasis for the wide range of environmental conditions](eugenics#homeostasis) which necessarily accompany a long life. The two seem to go hand in hand quite well.

On the other hand, once such a system is developed, returning to a fast-breeder lifestyle like rats or mice, should not cancel the advantage of being a mammal, with basically the same body plan and inner organs as a human.
It ensues, that as far as I am concerned I do not believe any mammal should ever be sensitive to viral diseases, nor parasites, in its natural state with the diet it is meant to eat. **Wide-spread pollution** could have a disproportionate effect. Animals living in degraded environments with a poor food range - and for some reasons can not go elsewhere - are bound to weaken a lot are bound, to show symptoms of **deficiencies**, not too different from those we get with eating cooked food, to some respect.

We need to draw a line or rather identify two opposite poles, on one hand "evolved" species whose individuals treat parasites and viruses like mere tools, and primitive ones which rather discard the unfit individuals themselves instead of the waste they carry. While our understanding of mammals has reached perfection in this respect, more experiences and studies need to be done with fish, crustaceans, insects, etc, which seemingly possess a much, much wider breadth of variation than we see within vertebrates. Ergo a "harsh" natural selection makes complete sense for **primitive** species. **Primitives** in the sense of the **capacity for homeostasis**, which only partially coincides with intelligence or we tend to see as <q>evolution</q>. The same goes for lifespan: Living a century can be achieved for lower lifeforms when their metabolic rate is low. Not much <q>happens</q> inside.

On the contrary maintaining life and body integrity during a long but very active life despite the constant breaking down of cells and proteins, requires either/or an efficient physiology limiting the turn-over rate to a minimum or incredibly fine-tuned cellular biology, completely reverting the accumulating damages (internal and external). The only way to verify our theories is to take a whole lot of fish we know are sick of whatever pathogen, put them in a safe place with a rich diet, and see how quickly the parasite load dwindles... or not. Same for all the other cases mentioned [in the article above](fallen#wild_diseases).

The complete theory as applied to the viral phenomena, can be found on the following page, while I also wrote an essay comparing extensively the similarity in form and function between the evil viruses, and the good exosomes, with which our cells exchange information:

### Deregulation of breeding

The nature of human reproduction are all glaring symptoms of our present state being unnatural, unharmonious, either suffering from cooking and/or having degenerated from an earlier more perfect one, since at least the neolithic revolution. More precisely our reproductive function and tendency has been **grossly** exaggerated, **overclocked**, on a physiological level, breaking havoc in our health as well as mental balance, scarring our culture for millenia perhaps more than [all other issues combined](meta).

We should not have so many children, our biological cycle should be based on their needs. Cooking participates in a singular acceleration of our rhythm of life, for several reasons:
1. The molecular chaos represented by AGEs and other abnormal substances constitutes cellular stress due to their direct or indirect cytotoxic, genotoxic, mutagenic, carcinogenic effects, etc...
1. By directly amplifying the impulses linked to the instinctive reproductive program which explains the preponderance of heterosexuality cooking is accompanied by a profound change in the state of mind, and from there imagining a hormonal action induced on the gonads do not require a considerable leap of faith.
1. Maturation and aging[](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arr.2019.100982 "Jiao Luo, Kevin Mills, Saskia le Cessie, Raymond Noordam, Diana van Heemst, Ageing, age-related diseases and oxidative stress: What to do next? (2019)")[](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/01.HYP.38.2.274 "Age-Related Reduction of NO Availability and Oxidative Stress in Humans, Stefano Taddei & al (2001)") are strongly linked. This same molecular stress mentioned in 1, is involved in aging in the form of "oxidative stress"[](https://doi.org/10.1038/sj.ki.5002382 "E. Schleicher, U. Friess, Oxidative stress, AGE, and atherosclerosis (2007)")[](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1161/01.ATV.0000058402.34138.11 "John F. Keaney Jr & al, Obesity and Systemic Oxidative Stress, Clinical Correlates of Oxidative Stress in The Framingham Study (2003)")[^s].

{.center cite="[Reproductive aging in captive and wild common chimpanzees: factors influencing the rate of follicular depletion](www.doi.org/10.1002/ajp.20650)"}

To which we can add operational menopause (complete cessation of cycles): estimated to 35-40 for captive chimpanzees, and 50 in the wild, [most of the time **never** observed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16941957/ "The effects of aging on hormone and reproductive cycles in female chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), 2006").

The differences between wild and captive chimpanzees is striking (especially the earlier sexual maturity[^chimps_lab]), and can resumed to the effect of the [zoo diet](fallen#zoo-diet-gorilla). Now compare this is what happens with women with diet rich in fat and/or processed food, in a traditional demographic regime, with constant intercourse and no contraceptive:
- sexual maturity **8–13**
- periodicity of ovulations: 21-35 days, 28 on average
- first birth (with constant intercourse and in absence of contraceptive): 8-13 immediate
- Maximum lifespan: 85 (in good health), 100+ otherwise
- [Operational menopause]: 38.7–60.0, with an average of 49.6

The normalcy of at least four constants so far need to be revised:
- the [adolescent growth spurt](.#puberty)
- the [uselessness of breastfeeding as a contraceptive](.#interbirth) compared to animals
- the existence of [menopause and menstruations](#menstruation)

**Starting from the widely acknowledged human growth curve anomaly among all animals:** Usually we can see the height curve is rather linear during childhood, to show a weight of inflection and in adolescence, what is called the puberty peak: this does not happen in raw children, there is no puberty crisis, growth (and the development of secondary sexual signs) is slow and prolonged, with no truly identifiable beginning or end. On average they are a little smaller but this is not comparable to a lack of growth because they are stronger and much healthier: in truth we are too fat and of poor bone constitution, because of dairy products.

![](/Images/biology/serious_charts/courbes_adolescence.webp "Human growth curve vs chimpanzees")
{.center cite="Human Growth and Development in *Basics in Human Evolution*, 2015 "}

We then see that although growth (and weight gain) accelerates during puberty, the transition from puberty to fully adult age is abnormally rapid. The onset of secondary sexual signs should be slow and continuous, instead of sudden and quasi-traumatic, as the majority of adolescents can confirm. Size does not matter, all mammals, including cows and mice, show a similar growth curve, just more or less elongated. Even more, they do not have as strong a hormonal surge as we experience at puberty[^hormones], which is associated with a multitude of health issues[^breastfeeding].
{#puberty}

The juvenile phase exists in all intelligent social animals, which makes sense given its obvious learning function. This is the most dangerous period regarding post-neonatal mortality (predators and the danger of competing males, in the case of lions). This period is in absolute and relative terms the longest by far among the human species... With here significant differences between Africans and Asians/Europeans.

Our view is that there is a general, underlying factor in obesity and early maturation: molecular pollution in all its aspects, that it causes obesity. Guyclaude's children reached maturity only toward 25, while being consistently more muscular than all other kids their age.

[Little or no breastfeeding](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12887-019-1661-x) also relates to faster development. This can be explained in several ways: lack of breast milk leads to paradoxical development, directly stressing the body, endocrine balance, etc. Denatured molecules accumulate more because milk allows the body to learn how to better clean/get rid of them.
The lack of *human* milk also certainly leads to a paradoxical development, directly stressing the body, endocrine balance, etc, as we know its importance for the *development of the brain*. The Quechua Indians seem to feature by far the most delayed growth ever, ending at no earlier than 22, while still congruent with an admirably strong, sturdy body[^Fisancho]. The classic undernutrition or apoxy explanation is inadmissible because their strength and overall health put city people to shame. Beside, [Tibetans](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6614862/#:~:text=Women%20in%20a%20Tibetan%20speaking,by%20the%20status%20quo%20technique.) directly contradicts it, with periods closer in time to ours (16) but an ever earlier menopause (45 versus 52 here), as well as their overall aging. But unlike Peruvians, they eat *much more (cooked) meat and worse cereals too*. Recent studies corroborated that association[^confirm].

These accelerations in growth (inflection point) are always so small relatively (regardless of size, in mice or cows) that they cannot be compared to ours, because it should be enough for them to **look** to get a clear picture. Yet instead we resort to dishonest mathematical tools to level the difference, erase our uniqueness among mammals. And from one study to the other, no one can agree on what methodology he deems legitimate[^Bogin].
The other line of arguments claims that hormones and chemical biomarkers do support the notion of a transition to puberty. But no one has denied this, for genitals growing must certainly start at _**some**_ point. The point of contention is about the speed at which it goes, and whether it shows with the **naked** eye. Collagen and osteocalcin levels ([indicators of bone turn-over](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhevol.2023.103341 "The evolution of the adolescent growth spurt: Urinary biomarkers of bone turnover in wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) (2023)")) as well as creatine and testosterone do not mean much if anything in practice if we can not see the result in terms of actual growth. One must consider the *sensibility to these hormones*, which appears to involve up to a *ten-fold difference from chimpanzees to humans*[^hormon_levels].

Most recently a [new article](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.86635.3 "Evidence for adolescent length growth spurts in bonobos and other primates highlights the importance of scaling laws (2023)") claimed to end the debate by redefining the adolescent growth spurt altogether, arguing that the correct way to plot height against age requires **raising height to the power of 2.5** first. Why such a gross amplification (timidly called "rescaling") should be legit when the spurt is not only visible for humans with mere linear plotting but often drastic ?

The juvenile phase exists in all intelligent social animals, which makes sense given its obvious learning function. This is the most dangerous period for postneonatal mortality. Incidentally, note here significant differences between Africans and Asians/Europeans. There are two basic ways to get from infancy to adulthood. One is to develop quickly and minimize the duration of the nonreproductive period between weaning and sexual maturation. The other strategy is to develop toward adulthood slowly, increasing the time for learning and producing higher quality adults.

What we call "traditional demographic regime" (free sexual activity and no contraceptives nor modern medicine) is described as "high stationary", because **understandably** Such parameters give rise to a very high birth rate, 4 to 8 deliveries per woman in the Middle Age but only because of the custom of marrying late in your 20s, several years past sexual maturity or even the fertility peak, and other regulatory practices. Backward African countries bent on maximizing natality show us the expected result in nature with constant intercourse, as per our instincts, which is an excess of 7 children, up to 12, without multiple births.

The only reason this regime is called "high stationary", is because this high nativity is compensated by an equally high *infant mortality, plus wars and famines*: all factors leaving no traces before the Neolithic revolution, and that could not have existed before cooking. That means that in absence of social regulations of matrimony, a people whose food is somewhat rawer, somewhat more vital and richer in vitamins, thus enjoying a good health and no epidemics, around the level of the [least disturbed chimpanzees](viral_phenomenon#truncated-lifespans-and-mental-diseases) **would witness an explosive demographic growth**.

This alone suffices to reveal a horrifying error in our biology. Evolution made us apex, for millions of years, before even our divergence from fellow apes. Thus a monstrous fertility makes no sense. That's why an innate ecological sense must evolve for species like ours, let them destroy their environment and themselves in the process *as is happening ever faster*. And since animals do not take well-thought-out "rational decisions", we are obviously talking of unconscious mechanisms, animals have no awareness of.

*Without diseases and infantile mortality to compensate*, a default natality of more than 3 children on average suffices to cause a net demographic growth, and be ecologically unsustainable. Species like ours need to measure and curtail its reproduction to fit the bearing capacity of its environment, as shown by meerkats and wolves for instance... and chimpanzees. Otherwise, because the environment is neither infinitely flexible or abundant, until groups must contend with increasing stress and dearth of food, endangering everyone's health and so the survival of the group. Despite no ape being a seasonal breeder properly speaking (we are fertile all year long) in both chimpanzees and hunter-gatherer populations, birth peaks are known to coincide with periods of food abundance, not only from season to season but year to year as well[^food_availability].

A hard-boiled belief in the scientific community is that all species would tend to produce as many offspring as possible given available resources, and would fill the environment if predators or other environmental constraints disappeared[^few_periods]. Some species *require* predation to maintain the ecological balance, on which many other animals or plants depend, including those they feed on. The point of life is to survive, not to increase beyond measure. And an unlimited multiplication would lead to the destruction of the environment, as we realize this bitterly today.

**Let us look at the weaning/interbirth time variable**: because chimpanzees basically mate constantly (like we do), despite a dominance of lesbian relationships most females are either pregnant, or with a child. So what delays one pregnancy from the other, *is only the time taken for the offspring to wean*.
How to calculate this for humans ?
In the US a fourth of all babies start out with baby formula, and half are given it by the 6th month, so people *hardly ever* breastfeed more than a year, against an average of **5 kids** in wild chimpanzees. But it *wouldn't matter* because today, with a "rich" diet breastfeeding **only acts as a contraceptive for the first six month**. And it is said that the LAM (breastfeeding) method only works if milk is the only food but this is not the case for chimpanzees, as from experience in just a few days infants smell and eat all kinds of food including meat, simply squeezing juices out of it for lack of chewing instruments.
{#interbirth}

The replacement rate for [great apes](fallen#predation_negligeable) is low, around 5, because of infant mortality (and taking into account the rare accidents) but in humans experience showed this reduced to zero. So in our case, **more than 3 would be an ecological catastrophe**. Yet even if the inter-birth time had not dwindled and we had to wait 5 years between births, considering a fertility window of 30 years *this would still leave room for a minimum of 5 children*.

With our diet menstruations disappear entirely in a few months without any adverse effect on fertility, as well as the famous pain of childbirth, after a year. The strong tendency for inflammation or autoimmunity caused by a permanent influx of denatured cooked molecules also disappears, releasing a treasure of bodily capabilities and resistance to muscle and psychological stress of all kinds. With time (more or less years depending on the choice of food) the tissues rebuild themselves on a stronger and more durable healthy basis.
{#menstruation}

![](/Images/spirituality/mythology/lilith.webp "Lilith")

It is well known that captive animals develop significantly faster, breed faster and have shorter times of lactation per offspring, and shorter ovulation cycles. As a consequence their ovarian reserve deplete faster - reaching reproductive senescence early - and also age faster overall: every life history parameters reflect a shorter, faster life cycle. We can almost talk of a transition from a K to a r breeding strategy. A gradual cessation of fertility appears in all species, but except in ours it narrows down to a few years death, *matching overall health*. Healthy individuals maintain fertility until the end of their maximum lifespan[^even_same_age_captive]. On the contrary women keep being functional for more than 25% (up to 50% in case of centenarians and beyond) of our lifespan and captive, as do other captive apes[^gorilla_1].

**Compare it to the new human condition under instinctive diet:**
- adolescent growth spurt disappear, development is continuous, in height as well as secondary sexual characteristics
- **Periods disappear after one year of correct practice**.
- sexual maturity is not visibly before 18 accomplished, or older.
We also see that long periods (in excess of a year, with daily intercourses) of unprotected activity in some circumstances may not lead to no pregnancy, while in other circumstances, when they want it, women have multiple babies, indicating an unaffected fertility.
Unfortunately because of external circumstances, no data on old women continuing the regime exists.

Historically in regions less dependent on typically neolithic-related "advancements" (less milk and cook meat) menstruations used to start *closer to the age of seventeen than to thirteen*, and **in some regions after 20**[^rollet]. Several doctors attribute this delay in puberty to the arduous work to which girls from the countryside are subjected. They are aware of the city/country differences and grant a certain influence to the “passions” which agitate city dwellers earlier. It is the climate, finally affirms the doctor from Bourg‑Saint‑Andéol, which explains the advance in puberty of the girls of this small town. The climate hypothesis dominated the discourse on puberty for a long time. There is a certain astonishment among these doctors: ultimately, the late age of menarche seems to them to be an anomaly, pointing to a poor economic and health situation. However, some are reassured, this late puberty does not prevent high fertility; in some cases, *the late age at first menstruation can be compensated by also late menopause*, which extends the period of fertility.

"Pale colors" are often associated with those girls in the moment of their period. But since these children are nevertheless always *strong and healthy*, we can assume that *this “delay” in constitution does not correspond to a lack of development, but to a natural state*. It is not malnutrition. On the contrary, these observations show that physical strength, the strength of an adult, is unrelated to maturing as an adult. In a sense children used to grow tall, but not old, or very, very slowly.

Even then, the label of malnutrition (and being "*[underweight](ADD_REF "add text study about raw food and weight")*" often sticks to what are simply children growing at a more natural rate, or not as fat as nearly everyone is today. And could we deem “pathological” a reduced fertility, when the norm is absolutely unsustainable from an ecological standpoint ?
So, late periods correlate with a less abundant onslaught of denatured molecules
Idle children from the city age faster and *weaker*. This comes from the accumulation of denatured molecules, in the same way that puberty conditions the appearance of pimples etc: a growth which occurs stops seeing the toxins concentrate and require additional outlets. Additionally an urban setting offers more abundant and more processed food, more meat among other things.
These analyses were clearly underpinned by a “populationist” concern, emerging during this second half of the 18th century8. In the speeches of doctors before the Revolution, we read about all the supposed factors which influence the age at menarche, except the **food factor which is not put forward**, at least in these texts addressed to the Society royal medicine.

Food is questioned in the 19th century but in the opposite direction to common sense: despite the fact that women could produce **fifteen** children for the authorities it was still not enough, pushing them to introduce wine to richer food. Illustrating their fall into materialism, Revolutionaries and Republicans became obsessed with making women breed the most and the soonest possible.
However, the changes took time to be observed, perhaps because the added foods (wine, meat?) did not constitute very significant factors of disorder, unlike the foods which formerly characterized the cities compared to the countryside: sugar white, chocolate, complicated ready meals, etc[^bzdoez]. In time peasants would eat at the same table as the nobles of yester century[^increase_modern]. 
Some physicians however, having more common sense, understood perfectly that later menarche is the sign of a more robust constitution, giving a better health and was often accompanied by a late menopause[^notes].

Mirroring what we see in apes, we believe menopause (anticipated cessation of fertility) simply **should not exist**. It makes no sense evolutionarily speaking and does not get corroborated in other primates[^primate]. Though we lacked the occasion to observe it yet, considering how well we saw people age, we should at least expect women to stay fertile in their 70s. Such women would look much more attractive and young than the grandmas of today, easily 20 years younger, so it would really not be such a stretch.

While wild apes have very little bleeding - much less than we do - women under instinctotherapy had *absolutely none*. Yet had no issue getting pregnant **when desired**. Ovulations include symptoms such as cramps, an increase in [cervical mucus, breast tenderness, fluid retention, and appetite or mood changes](https://www.thebump.com/a/ovulation-symptoms-signs-of-ovulation). And they were under the impression that ovulation just did not happen cyclically anymore.
[Already in chimpanzees](https://bmcecolevol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12862-016-0691-3), ovulation and visible estrus (genital swellings indicative of fertility) are strongly **uncoupled**[^decouplage_bonobo], as they mate constantly, in and out of fertile periods. The higher the life expectancy, the lower the frequency of childbirth must be in absence of external regulation lest for the population to explode then die from the depletion of their food source. The latter may happen with some inferior animals in some ecological contexts, but all higher animals, especially predators (or generally non-preys) display behavioral mechanisms to that effect.

Wouldn't the conscious control of procreation be the continuation of what seems already nascent in our cousins, the complete subordination of reproduction to the metapsychic instinctive program ?
While lutein levels could not be measured (to ascertain the absence of ovulation), women can know by other hints too, physical and nervous. They observed an equilibration of mood and perhaps most shockingly, a spontaneous and totally effective birth control without contraception, without caring for the type of contact or ejaculating inside.
	
While ultimately hormones are all commanded by the brain, a number of nerve endings lie in direct contact with follicles in the ovaries[^nerves], serving as a credible candidate to serve in a **conscious or unconscious triggering of ovulation**.
{.important}

In Mont-Ramé, Guy‑Claude Burger (from personal communications) has had daily intercourse for a whole year with a certain "Daisy", and nothing happened. Then a single intercourse with a very base, low-quality unsophisticated man, impregnated her (paternity test confirming). Because Mr Burger had had several children already (and would go on having a total of 7), assuming for some reason her cycles had been interrupted *for a whole year*, the odds for her ovulating in a six-day window **in that precise moment** are very slim.
We must conclude, then, that ovulation must have been triggered by the brain in response to a sexual interaction in a very degraded context, void of energy, marked by the reproductive program.
We believe the end of cyclicity and the direct placing of reproduction under control of the mind, the part of it related to energetic phenomena (over-id) has been the latest adaptation in our ape lineage, in the following context of:
- our constant promiscuity
- the extension of lifespan beyond any other mammal
- the necessity to continue refreshing the ovule stock due to atresia.

Because of the subtle nature of this function she really w's not been ovulating for all that time (a whole year), the chance for it to happen at that exact moment (well, in the 6-days window traditionally) seems incredibly slim.
Low-energy intercourses, especially in suggestible people raised in a cooked and sexually-deprived environment (hence that did not benefit from an extensive exposition to the [metapsychic instinctive program](meta)), could contaminate their mind and trigger breeding, and so, ovulation, fooling natural regulations.
As the recurrent overpopulation crises in history including in ancient times prove, such mode of regulation was absolutely necessary and the natural conclusion of an ongoing trend along tens of millions of years of evolution. 

Finally, children born after a certain period of instinct often came out with their amniotic sac on their heads, and **mothers did not lose water**.
As a result, births take place without any pain and potentially very quickly: the bag acting as hydraulic transmission. Presumably, this miracle (many women wouldn't use any other words!) comes from the best proteins under instincto. This makes her more able to absorb things, and the mother to work as if nothing had happened until the last month included...
No (wild) animal in creation gives birth any other way than easily, quickly, and painlessly (with the exception of hyenas who explode her clitoris, perhaps...). Natural humans make no exception. The bellows of agony, various complications, deaths in childbirth, indispositions, mood swings and rejections of the baby cannot be natural and we do not always find them in other cultures, or in time. If in the Middle Ages we could have up to 15, it goes without saying that pregnancies must have been infinitely easier and less dangerous than we imagine... without medicine.
Finally, once outside, the pouch ruptures on its own under the effect of enzymes, and likewise the umbilical cord dries up on its own after a day, giving the usual shape of the navel without any need to make a knot with. Another thing you won't believe.

## Fire and the origin of cooking

### The official myth

We make the case that fire was never needed to thrive, and that it is the cause of all bodily pathologies and suffering, directly or indirectly.
{.center .important}

Because we attack something so close to people's heart, maybe dearer than anything, anyone or any belief, something most think we can not even survive without let alone thrive,a logical reaction would be to wonder, why then it started in the first place, and how did it become universal ? Men have used and controlled fire fully or partially for more than a million years, but we believe that for the most part, it was not associated with cooked food, which came only recently (compared to the age of our species, which we will come back to later).

- ![](/Images/images_article_instincto/wrangham_quote.webp "<q>Muh fire.</q>")
- ![](/Images/images_article_instincto/wrangham_book_goodness_paradox+demonic_male.webp "<q>Men are all **evil**</q>")
{.center #wrangham}

In 1995, the British primatologist Richard Wrangham formalized in [<q>Catching Fire</q>](/Images/images_article_instincto/catching_fire_wrangham_book.webp) what everyone in paleontology and anthropology, not to mention the general public, had thought for a long time, namely the hypothesis that the reduction of the jaw and the size of the teeth accompanying the growth of the brain in Homo Erectus and the species that followed it would not have been possible without an early mastery of fire allowing the cooking of food. Thus cooking, by outsourcing part of our digestion, would have allowed us to waste less time and energy eating, devoting these resources to developing our brain[^brain] and properly human symbolic activities.
R. Wrangham is the quintessence embodiment of everything rotten in modern science: Not only is he an enemy regards to cooking but he spearheaded the notion of Chimpanzees being raping killing machines viciously waiting for the smallest overtures to gang up on females and children.

Moreover, his thesis would date the mastery of fire to nearly two million years ago, whereas the certain habitual use of fire in households dates, for most specialists, to 500,000 years at most... as reported for the Qesem cave  which associates the earliest control of fire mainly with the first Homo sapiens and Neandertals. In 2012, microstratigraphic evidence (based on microscopic analysis of sedimentary layers, looking for chemical or isotopic traces) of the earliest fire use by hominids in situ one million years ago in the Acheulean strata of Wonderwerk Cave, Northern Cape Province, South Africa, arrived. 
This is considered unequivocal evidence for the habitual use of fire by Homo Erectus.

![Image of the microstratigraphic article](/Images/images_article_instincto/image_article_microstrati.webp)

Does this mean that cooking is a million years old? Not really.
Simply a fire nurtured with food remains of the last meal. However, it illustrates well the ease with which the overwhelming majority of specialists (and common folk) just can't separate fire from cooking. First, I would like to make a point about the state of meat consumed in nature. The idea that cooking is necessary for the digestion of raw meat comes mainly from the fact that we imagine a fresh leg of lamb with the consistency of rubber.

In reality, meat only becomes edible - and much better digested than in the cooked state - [when it is allowed to age](maturation_faisandage_en).
{.important}

If a prehistoric man used fire but did not cook, what did he use it for ? Several hypotheses can be put forward:
1. to scare animals at night to sleep in peace (especially since we no longer sleep in trees)
2. to light up
3. to keep warm
{.col_2}

We believe that in nature, fire has never been more than an accessory for our ancestors, whose body and brain were perfectly adapted to not only survive but thrive. So none of the listed reasons hold.This is not to say that fire does not warm or light. But we just did not need it. Our natural abilities are ensured in all environments). Most people, including scientists, think fire instinctively scares all animals... This is wrong. Try it in the African savannah and the next day you might be missing a few toes, with the compensation of having caused a nice indigestion to a lioness or hyena: because these intelligent animals are not afraid of fire.

Of course they avoid it and know its danger, but a fire that is neither too big nor too fast will not worry them at all. The same goes for wolves and bears. Most animals flee from humans, and it is proven that it is the human presence behind the fire that discourages them... but that also means that if you do nothing special to keep them away, they would not come. On the contrary, some will be attracted by the smell, and if they smell something they like they will come and help themselves. So it's habitual behavior: they will come all the more if they recognize the human presence and associate it with food. But there is more: fire often indicates cooking so the particular smell will have the same effect of fascination on animals as it has on us. Fire is very well-known not to repeal animals but attract them, which in the case of bears is **bad news**.

Lastly we are not natural prey for any animal. Neither sharks nor tigers will instinctively pounce on us until they are starved to death... or drugged by the denatured molecules. Numbers alone would deter predators interested in your children or pets, more than fire can. Also, don't expect to keep mosquitoes away either. There is very little reality behind the common picture of weak prehistorical men only surviving the assault of cruel wild beasts with the product of his brain.

As for lighting, of course, we are not cats, we do not have a tapetum lucidum which reflects light behind their pupils. Incidentally they have 150 million rods instead of our 120. But in the end, it's not a question of being able to hunt in the forest as if it were daylight... but simply of managing to navigate through obstacles two or three meters around you, in the dark. And this is easy enough if the moon is beautiful, and the stars numerous... Which was always the case before the industrial age.

There is a special training for night vision (scotopic), well studied during the Second World War. It is often mentioned about "wild children" that they have excellent eyesight, especially in the dark. It is hard to say how far this can go. In any case, it is obvious that the long-term adaptation capacities of the eyes are more important than is said... Similarly, the sense of smell and hearing of these children is described as being above the average person.	

[Research shows primates to be very active during the night ](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29417991/), which closes point 2. We obviously evolved to find our way around at night even in the darkness of rainforest forests (which aren't that dark actually), it is not the same for the caves, devoid of any light, so much so that typically the animals having evolved in them, lose all sense of vision, become blind. As mentioned below charred bones could constitute a solution.

**Regards to heat**:
The question is: Does primitive man need fire to survive? In tropical countries, no, it is rather too hot. Even in Southern Europe one might bitterly regret not being able to tear off one's skin, once already naked. This is not the case in a continental climate like say... Aveyron, in France: 20° in August, **5°** in November. Yet:
> [Victor de l'Aveyron](/Images/images_article_instincto/victor_aveyron.webp), famous wild child perhaps born in the Tarn around 1785 and found in the Aveyron in 1797 at about twelve years old used to live naked as a worm, and although unlike other wild children, he came to take refuge in the houses several times, he was still said to be insensitive to heat and cold

More convincing: Meet Wim Hof or **Iceman**

{.center}

> I am able to control the body only through the power of the mind" said Hof, who calls himself the "Ice Man". "The cold is unforgiving. It shows you where you are. What you are."
{.aside}

The ultimate test for Hof was an Arctic half-marathon (21 km). He would have to battle the prolonged effects of exposure to the cold (average of -20°C). Experts estimated that a normal person would not last 15 minutes running in such conditions. At first, Hof ran at a steady, consistent pace. But halfway through, he began to falter. After three hours of exposure to the icy conditions, Hof's mental powers began to fade. After five hours, Hof could no longer run. But his slowness increased the risk of cold damage.

In 2002, he spent 6 minutes 20 seconds under the polar ice. In spring 2007, Wim Hof climbed Everest (Tibetan side - North East Ridge route) with minimal technical equipment to withstand the cold. Wim Hof was equipped with shorts, gloves and a cap, but had to stop at 7,400m due to a foot injury sustained during the half marathon in January.
In 2004, in the Netherlands, he spent 1 hour and 08 minutes in a tube filled with ice. On 26 January 2008, in New York, he stayed 72 minutes in a translucent container filled with ice, beating his 2004 record of 68 minutes.

And many monks develop similar abilities in Tibet through concentration and training, which is now being studied in the laboratory under controlled conditions. Difficult to guess what use such adaptability might have had for African apes: what sense is there to survive in places where nothing grows anyway ? We can safely assume that at no time did we **need** fire as long as they stayed where there was food to eat, which in any case excludes the Arctic Circle. Even so, clothing (animal hides) would provide more than adequate protection.

### A mystery still whole

![Cursory representation of the evolution of brain in the homo lineage](/Images/biology/image_tous_les_cerveaux.webp)
{.center}

Fire allowed, obviously, for an unprecedented development of technology. These are the only arguments that hold water for me. Homo Erectus seemingly got to control fire. Determining the intelligence of Homo Erectus is more difficult than it seems, because even if his brain (546 to 1251 cm³) was notoriously smaller than ours (1200-1500). Anatole France, a writer and moral authority of the first order in the 19th century, recognized as such by Marcel Proust, had a brain of around 850 cm³. Was Erectus perhaps remarkably more intelligent than we imagine ?
No artifacts have been found suggesting a use for, say, hardening spears or making tar for the same effect, as has been shown for Neandertals. That said, a long time has passed and absence of evidence is not the evidence of absence. It could mean on the other hand, that current humans are well, well below our potential, because of cooking and other circumstances.

![Picture of fire](/Images/images_article_instincto/fire_bandeau.webp)

Fire fascinates, that's for sure, every child knows, just as it certainly did for our ancestors. The brain sizes we are talking about, from Erectus to early "men", doesn't exclude, for the longest time, a mostly symbolic use of fire. Some functions of fire that few people think of:
- Burnt bones become fluorescent, and are very effective as a [light in cellars](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jasrep.2020.102333 "Autofluorescence of experimentally heated bone: Potential archaeological applications and relevance for estimating degree of burning (2020)")
- Burnt animal remains are hardly unmistakable signs of cooking, as the food remains are always thrown on the hearth to maintain it.

Thus it is quite impossible to ensure with any certainty that burnt remains involve culinary practices, as is equally impossible to know whether said bones (or what covered it) were eaten before, or after getting frisky with the holy flame.
The quantity of such burnt remains may be indicative, but these clues are both rare and always in need of interpretation. On the other hand, the majority of tuberous vegetables such as manioc are absolutely impossible to eat raw, as are grasses (some cereals such as maize can though). Their place in today's diet is explained by the opiates they contain, which make for a [terribly addictive effect](https://thefnc.com/research/gluten-and-dairy-are-like-addictive-drugs-to-the-brain/ "Gluten and dairy are like addictive drugs to the brain").
The first attested  granaries date back to 11,000 BC. The consumption of cereals may of course be older. I am of the opinion that cooking must have appeared several times in several places, more or less accidentally, because consequent control and taking thousands of years to develop, allowed sufficient food security to concentrate populations in sedentary centers, contrary to what has always been the case. This article may point to an early, if short-lived, establishment of cooking and cereals[^article].

One can conceive cooking must have fascinated relatively primitive populations in terms of intelligence, *once a certain brain size threshold was reached, say, 800 cm³ perhaps*. But groups falling prey to this lack of instinctive programming against the product of our own intelligence, soon would degenerate physically, devoured by predators (as happening with Bengali tigers) or supplanted by other healthier human groups, either breeding them out of existence or slaughtering them as an act of mercy.

Studies (and the experience of any animal breeder or farmer whatsoever since the beginning of husbandry) supports the universal preference or addicting effect that light *controlled* cooking is *intrinsically attractive* to animals[^study_cooking_animal]. But the thing is, light cooking is fairly rare and very difficult to pull off by chance, as opposed to the much more frequent occurrence of unappealing *charred remains* in the trail of wildfires, just like failing recipes 9 out of 10 ruins the result if not induces food poisoning.

Arguably, early recipes were probably much more **immediately** toxic than now, and got refined over time not to kill you too soon. That process happened automatically, as the faster the disorder, the easier one could make the association with said recipe. On the other hand, even a 100% chance of getting cancer or kidney failure 30 years after, is very unlikely to occasion any change. Such is the shortsightedness of the masses, *in particular when addiction kicks in*.

That all might explain, why only humans practice cooking willingly, despite a few animals having the intelligence to try it enough to *overcome the instinctive repulsion and get hooked*. Same could be said for smoking and alcoholism. Hence, animals getting hooked on half-baked cooked remains, for both practical and physiological reasons, is extremely rare, if by happenstance one happened to make it a habit, predators, mosquitoes and [all parasites in creation](ADD_REF) would make quick work of his deteriorating health. Such is the natural order, the beauty of natural selection, whose remnants haven't totally disappeared from the sanest human cultures.

After all, it was still customary in ancient Greece, though relatively cultured people, to immediately eliminate monsters and mutants at birth, any *abnormal* child. Many animals also have the impulse to reject abnormal individuals from the herd, and mothers to kill such young. It doesn't take much imagination to imagine the reaction of a healthy group meeting a half sick, half excited cooking group. From the point of view of natural selection, a genocidal behavior would make perfect sense.

Then as hominids reached a threshold in intelligence, we came able to repeat the mistake intentionally, and not live long enough afterwards to make babies... unfortunately cooking [increases fertility at all levels](meta), chemically, psychologically and socially, setting breeding instincts on overdrive on a biological level. So we can expect that after a certain population threshold, the health detriments would be offset and cooked groups would start breeding more than naturally, replacing others, eventually forcing them to intermarry due to the sheer pressure. Our intelligence conjugated with the unexpected effect on our nervous system, would have allowed individually sick individuals to gang up and survive, then take over.

That is Mr Burger's take. But I don't agree as it would imply a very early generalization of cooking, and very stupid early humans too, not really the demi-gods [our analysis led to](spirituality) nor a time compatible with the evolution of European racial morphology 50,000 years ago. The apparent reduction in brain size, we believe, [could only have come from self-domestication](neandertals), followed and accelerated by subsequent cereal consumption and sedentarisation. Europeans of that time were largely superior, making the simplistic thesis of a seamless world-wide adoption of cooking seem  very doubtful and *incomplete*.

Truth to tell, the origin of cooking might very well be the most important mystery ever, and the worst calamity ever to occur in the history of life.

## Hitler's insights

Hitler[^hitler] predicted a great many tendencies, and his insights covered a lot of areas too. A true polymath. But among the most chilling, awe-inspiring pieces of gold one can find in his <q>Table Talks</q>, are his numerous attacks on cooking. I laid them here, they deserve praise and comments when put in perspective in the light of our instinctive diet experiences several decades after, how remarkable he was there too, even if he wasn't always the first to make them.
- Hitler stated loudly the harmfulness of cooking in itself
- our extreme minimization of meat (animal in particular) would have met his unlimited approval as well.

Without a shadow of a doubt, a victorious Germany would have embraced instinctotherapy with open arms. Instead, decades after the war however gains in lifespan came nearly entirely from modern medicine, while *constitutional health* steadily decreased as indicated by the slow reduction for about 30 years of the [health-adjusted life expectancy]---or "healthspan"---and the heightened tendency to get sick, to quickly lose teeth without at least semi-regular dentist check-ups (an issue rare before WW2).

*We may come to the point, where the most advanced medical clutches can not compensate anymore for our organisms' rate of degradation*. What could happen for our current generation, if the medical infrastructure were to fail, due to EMPs, or a shortage of oil (vital to produce drugs) due to geopolitical reasons, or a global economic crisis ?

We saw the confirmation of those early intuitions: all but the most advanced terminal stage cancers proved remissible, in so far as people access a wide variety of food and stick to discipline as if their life depended on it... Because it really does. But usually people at such a stage, or before for that matter, like for AIDS, reject the most wondrous signs of healing to keep cooking, even when it comes with the come-back of symptoms, and near-certitude of death. It has been said that cancers can be fought back with the will to live: this can't possibly negate the reality of feeding shit to your body thrice a day, but at the same, we know for a fact that such a will is decidedly rare in most people, some desire - <q>to fit in</q> in a social group - *can and do override the most basic instincts, that of survival, no question asked*.

While Hitler was wrong in rejecting meat wholesale or that children would never hunt instinctively (we saw them do just that, with delight and without weapon), meat absolutely has very limited appeal for healthily calibrated bodies. I mean that it can be delicious, the best food in the world - as *all* food should be if they smell the best - but very rarely so, once in a while, a few times per month at best, and more so fish or reptiles.
I am not aware of Hitler's opinion of fish and seafood in general, let alone insects. Wild raw meat is no poison, and the body will definitely default to it for a significant amount of time if need be, however to conclude that the Ice Age made cooking a necessity is a fallacy: Many Ice Ages and Interglacials succeeded for the better part of the last million years. It stands to reason we adapted to them.

Moreover, people used to *move, a lot*: why on Earth would a tribe stay at a place with nothing to eat but animals which quickly enough would prove unsavory, relatively costly to catch compared to fruits, and weakening your folk the longer you keep on such an unbalanced diet (as proved by Inuits, until recently total raw foodists yet age very fast) ? *Animals would flee. But super-intelligent big-brained primates would not ?*

As I said, we underestimate the amount of food a wild forest would provide, mostly because we ceased to live in them and maintain our ecological role in this obligate co-dependent symbiosis when we started cooking, so even dense forests are no <q>primate forests</q> anymore. In the span of a few millennia, we *must* eat fruits for them to persist, through our feces, since beside bears (that we proceeded to genocide) no other animal in Europe presents the same balanced, omnivorous range of appeals plus active metabolic needs as us. Lastly, I strongly believe paleoclimatic modelization (let alone vulgarization material) is vastly erroneous , painting a picture of the Ice Age as a kind of barren, sterile no-man's land frozen half of the year. This could not be further from the truth.

Ice ages are defined by winter cold enough compared to hotter seasons, so that ice does not thaw entirely, but either sustain itself or pile-up over the years. A good part of Swedes, in particular the edges of hills and mountains, are in that situation, and forests do not shy from nearing glaciers. The same occurs in Switzerland, owing to its topology. It is a matter of temperature **averages**, and most of Sweden isn't barren half the year, but features summers hot enough to get naked comfortably. 
The part of Europe not under glaciers knew climates varying between modern day Sweden, Switzerland or Norway, with inland masses (and coastal areas, depending microclimates) had a lot more of the typical **continental** climate (unlike the current **temperate** one), with strong winters and [warm summers] as if suddenly placing France into Ukraine or Poland, or Russia for more Northern places. One could hardly call those regions deserts.

Beside, the idea circulates that paleolithic men were ubiquitists able to thrive in any sort of environment but mainly inhabiting **[woody forests](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2018.12.023 "Paleoecological and genetic evidence for Neanderthal power locomotion as an adaptation to a woodland environment (2019)")**. Then how to explain that most H-G populations, like North-American Indians, prefer meat when possible ? Excluding Inuits - who eat raw and have literally nothing else - we think cooked food is a potent drug. Cereals, as mentioned earlier, but where agriculture can not (or has not yet) developed **the most appealing food source is cooked meat**.
 
Although it is true that places where one has to eat animal food a priori also produce less of what we primates like, it still seems that people relying on meat quickly lose the ability to eat a lot of plant-based food, and their population get to correlate with animal population density, leading to a very inefficient and irrational use of the available resource, as confirmed by studies of hunter-gatherers populations[^study-meat].
Logic would entail that wherever you are on Earth, whatever the climate, you should eat more plants when they are available and more meat (or seafood) in the non-growing season. What we see is a nett shift in [trophic position] **even in the growing season when they shouldn't need to**, thus lowering the Φ[NPP], the fraction of the environment/forest's [net primary production]. Unfortunately studies lack the resolution to tell apart the effect of meat and different availability of edible food.

In fact, damage to cellular mechanics occurs with every attempt to metabolize substances that are not the substrates we are programmed for: free radicals are most often the consequence, not the cause. In addition, structural defects (in the form of bad fats and proteins) are just as important in aging, causing for example ingrown nails, skin wrinkles, and partly varicose veins (poor smooth muscles without tone).

I would rather wait a few years because it seems early, and if it is indeed about cooking and cereals - which I am not sure of – as obviously not persisted. There might have been a technical use of these products, perhaps an early onset of an industrial process rather than a dietary one.

Although later marriageable, people from the countryside always married younger..." [Texier-Olivier, F 20 271, 1808: 87-88](#)
	> Clearly, prefects are asked to indicate whether sexual maturity has accelerated since the Revolution as a result of changes in diet and wine consumption. The hypothesis of food is central in the question asked by the minister, which is not surprising coming from a chemist like Chaptal who was interested in wine and had shown that one could increase its alcohol content by adding sugar (so-called chaptalization process).

	> High ages at first menstruation are cited for several municipalities in the department of Seine-et-Marne between 1806 and 1815. Doctor responsible for observing the epidemics reigning in his department, Doctor Goupil signs very detailed reports on the municipalities that he inspects and places particular emphasis on menarche. It is these data which form the last point of this article. The women are also of average size, they are very fertile. Menstruation rarely begins before the age of 17. The menstrual flow which in the girls of Achères does not appear very early continues until the age of 50 and 55, which means that they are fertile for a very long time; *It is also not uncommon to see women aged 40 to 45 become mothers, something that is not commonly observed in large cities where menstruation begins at 12 or 13 and disappears between 40 and 45*.
	It follows that it is a real advantage for the population that the menstrual flow does not establish too early. **Moreover, we would be very mistaken if we considered early menstruation as the product of a more robust constitution, or a particular development of the genital organs. The opposite is observed every day. It is in the weak education that we give to women, in the habitual use of highly tasteful foods [...] that we must seek the cause of this precocity**. [1810](#)
	> A little after the publication of the major prefectural Memoirs, Doctor Goupil placed great emphasis on the high age of the first symptoms of puberty in the villages he inspected. **He considers this puberty delay to be an advantage because women are still quite often menstruated after fifty. Their fertility is rather high and the problems caused by menstruation are quite rare.** A populationist, the doctor only sees advantages in this situation from the point of view of fertility. He **regrets** the precocity he witnesses elsewhere.

	In some areas of the ovary, these cords fragment into small “nests” of epithelial cells. Typically, these nests (fragmented cords) consisting of granulosa-like epithelial cells lie *in proximity to primary follicles*. The nests are in contact or are *penetrated by nerve terminals*, and they appear to contribute epithelial elements to ovarian follicles.

	The emergent macroscopic relationships from the model are well supported by ethnographic observations of contemporary hunter-gatherers, revealing a causal mechanism whereby short growing seasons drive high fractions of meat in the diet, leading to greatly reduced population density per unit NPP largely as a result of trophic inefficiency. Our results suggest that a shift from meat-dominated to plant-dominated diet could have boosted the population much more than implied by NPP changes alone.

	[About cooking](#)
	When I'm told that 50 percent of dogs die of cancer, *there must be an explanation for that*. Nature has predisposed the dog to feed on raw meat, by tearing up other animals. *To-day the dog feeds almost exclusively on mixed bread and cooked meat*
	Country folk spend fourteen hours a day in the fresh air. Yet by the age of forty-five they're old, and the mortality amongst them is enormous. **That's the result of an error in their diet. They eat only cooked foods**
	Everything that lives on earth feeds on living materials. The fact that man subjects his foodstuffs to a physico-chemical process explains the so-called "maladies of civilization". If the average term of life is at present increasing, that's because people are again finding room for a naturistic diet. It's a revolution. That a fatty substance extracted from coal has the same value as olive-oil, that l don't believe at all!
	It's not impossible that one of the causes of cancer lies in the **harmfulness of cooked foods**. We give our body a form of nourishment that in one way or another is debased. At present the origin of cancer is unknown, but it's possible that the causes that provoke it find a terrain that suits them in incorrectly nourished organisms. *We all breathe in the microbes that give rise to colds or tuberculosis, but we're not all enrheumed or tuberculous*.
	*Nature, in creating a being, gives it all it needs to live*. If it cannot live, that's either because it's attacked from without or *because its inner resistance has weakened*. In the case of man, it's usually the second eventuality that has made him vulnerable

	[Meat](#)
	The consumption of meat is reduced the moment the market presents a greater choice of vegetables, and in proportion as each man can afford the luxury of the first fruits
	I suppose man became carnivorous because, *during the Ice Age*, circumstances *compelled him*. *They also prompted him to have his food cooked*, a habit which, as one knows to-day, has harmful consequences. Our peasants never eat any food that hasn't been cooked and re-cooked, and thus deprived of all its virtues.
	At the time when I ate meat, I used to sweat a lot. I used to drink four pots of beer and six bottles of water during a meeting, and I'd succeed in losing nine pounds ! When I became a vegetarian, *a mouthful of water from time to time was enough*.
	When I was a young man, the doctors used to say that a meat diet was indispensable for the formation of bones. This was not true. Unlike peoples who eat polenta, we have bad teeth. It occurs to me that this has something to do with a diet that's more or less rich in yeast. Nine-tenths of our diet are made up of foods deprived of their biological qualities.

	The girls started their period just after they had turned 13, on average, which is about half a year later than in the U.S. Keim said part of the reason for this difference may be that African-Americans tend to start their periods before white girls. On average, a girl got her period about 25 days earlier for every point her BMI increased. For a female of about average height and weight, a one-point change in BMI is equivalent to about six pounds.
	Overweight and obese girls, for example, got their period three to five months before normal-weight girls, said Anshu Shrestha, a graduate student at UCLA School of Public Health, who worked on the study.

	In Sologne, known for its insalubrity and poverty, Abbé Tessier, sent on a mission by the Royal Society of Medicine to investigate ergot rye, known for its abortifacient power, noted: <q>Women are very fertile, although they are *not regulated before eighteen or twenty years of age*: they cease to be so at thirty-six and forty. They have up to fifteen children.</q> [...](#) The worthy abbot emphasizes that this precocious inclination (to early love-making) is due to the <q>free communication of boys and girls who guard their flocks together and sleep in the same room</q>, but this nevertheless does not hasten an early puberty in any way.

	The children are *very healthy and very colorful* [but](#) as the *girls are brought up in a difficult exercise*, far above that which is necessary for the exercise of their functions, they are *adjusted very late*. The influence of physical work is underlined here. [in Brittany, Vieillevigne](#) Among people of the sex, *those who are not employed in rural work are settled from eleven to fourteen years old, those who are are occupied only from fourteen to eighteen years of age…* (1787)
	
	If girls who did not work had their periods earlier, it was undoubtedly because their parents had *enough to feed them properly (sic!)* by doing without their services in the fields.
	
	Among the women of Haute Auvergne, according to Doctor de Brieude:
	The constitution of women is sanguine like that of men: their weak and loose fiber makes the difference, because it makes them more humorous. Menstruation does not appear in them until the age of fourteen or fifteen; we find in the countryside where passions are silent longer, girls who have reached their eighteenth year without having seen anything, who nevertheless enjoy good health. When they flow easily, their duration is six days in a person of twenty to thirty years; they are abundant for three days; _this evacuation does not end until around **forty-eight or fifty years of age**_… [Brieude, 1782: 300](#)

	With an enormous jaw comparable to that of a chimpanzee, pre-humans found an energy balance by devoting only a small part of their time to efficient chewing of raw food, [summarizes Mr Hladik](https://laboutique.edpsciences.fr/produit/390/9782759809172/la-chimie-et-l-alimentation).

	This analysis aims at determining to what extent spontaneous alcohol drinking in adult male rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) analysis aims at determining to what extent spontaneous alcohol drinking in adult male rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) represents ethanol-directed behavior.
	It is shown that in a condition of free access to an ethanol/water solution (2 percent v/v) and drinking water, alcohol drinking was *initiated in all subjects (n = 4) within a few days, without any specific induction procedure*.
	When ethanol concentrations in the solutions increased, consumption of ethanol solutions decreased, drinking water increased, and total water decreased. *Net ethanol intake from a certain solution was influenced by its concentration and the concentration of the concurrently available solution.* After an initial increase, total net ethanol intake remained relatively constant. Consumed amounts of ethanol (on the average 2-6 ml.kg- ~ per day) could lead to notable blood ethanol levels. The observed alcohol drinking is interpreted as resulting from a central reinforcement of ethanol intake and avoidance of negative, potentially harmful effects of ethanol.

	The Waxwings metabolized alcohol (with the 1 g/kg dose) 3.3 times as fast as the Starlings and 7.2 times as fast as the Greenfinches, while the Starlings metabolized it 2.2 times as fast as the Greenfinches. The rate of alcohol metabolism was approximately 40 mg/kg/h faster after the larger dose than after the smaller dose in all three species . The difference was significant in the Starlings (P<0 .001) and the Greenfinches (P<0.01) but not with the Waxwings because of their larger variation.

	ADH activities and isoenzymes:
	The ADH activity of Waxwing liver, measured as mMol/min/mg protein, was on average 15 times as high as that of Starlings and 6.2 times as high as that of Greenfinches (Table 3) . In Waxwings the liver constitutes 4.9 % of the total body weight ; in both Starlings and Greenfinches only 2.8 %. The whole liver ADH activity of Waxwings is 23 times as high as that of Starlings and Greenfinches.

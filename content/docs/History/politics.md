We aim to prompt a fundamental change in our way of life through the rediscovering of our original human instincts, in terms of alimentation, sexuality, spirituality and politics.
National-naturalism is at once a worldview, a political model and a religion, based on a threefold discovery about the true origins of Man, in particular of our White European, Nordic race.
Decades of scientific researchs and observations revealed that the White race originated not in Africa but Europe as the much more advanced Neanderthals, owning strengths of body, a ten-fold lifespan and psychic abilities reaching that of the gods of stories, before mutations introduced by cooked food  degenerated us into our present state. 
The national-naturalist movement wishes to return our race to its God-given original state, by restoring a raw food diet guided by instincts, thus restoring perfect health, and by 

restore real *magic* in the form of an untapped well of psychic abilities and intelligence, by learning from childhood the true extrasensory purpose of sexuality
1. Recreate our race thorough the latest science of eugenics

We are nationalist, because only an immense concentration of power and resources, within totalitarian and collectivist state, will achieve those goals. Only then can the full might of our people and its science be harnessed. And we are naturalist, because our principles derive from science and experience, and not any particular tradition[^tradition]. We ask for a type of science free from prejudices, going beyond the materialistic and moralistic postulations of modern academia. A science that doesn’t bend its perception of nature in service of a preconceived morality or ideology, but one that creates ideology and morale straight from facts, in service of nature. The Nature we refer to is revealed through personal experiences along with an impartial, amoral observation of our closest primate cousins..

## Ecology

Before the end of this century, possibly before 2050, the natural resources of the world will be fully depleted while the global population (compounded by its industrial progress) will reach an absolute peak, and world wars most likely involving nuclear weapons will occur will cause untold numbers to die, around racial and religious lines. With no foreseeable (voluntary) slowing down, and considering the White race is the only one even remotely interested in ecology and sustainable development, without taking extreme measures Europeans will die out and then the whole of humanity not long after.

![Curve of world population during the whole existence of our species](/Images/biology/serious_charts/curvepopulation.webp "Mondial population throughout history")

In a hundred years from now if not before, everything we grew to love: The great majority of wild animals, insects, plants, forests, will be no more, leaving a scarred planet as humans set into motion the biggest extinction event since that of the dinosaurs. **Humanity in its current form is a plague on our planet.**
Non-White countries which gained access to the product of Western technology such as China, India and the Middle-East, while at the same time lacking our most basic ecological tendencies, are all racial, ecological and ideological enemies of the first order. 

We realize that ecology (universal interest) and national interest, when it comes to the superior races endowed with consciousness, are one and the same. The destiny of Life itself on the planet and that of our race are united[^united]. Their indefinite survivals in the future depend on each other.

**The primary imperative of the State is to acquire absolute power on the geopolitic level in the long run to safeguard our survival at all costs.**

Any action: trade, temporary alliance and wars will be taken as we see fit. All resources must be spent on increasing national power and eliminating dangers.
In particular polluters like China, Brazil and India, mainly responsible for unimaginable suffering and destruction, by the end of this century, should be exterminated, lest life as we know it ceases to be on this planet. The stronger we get on all levels (industrially, militarily, scientifically) the more leverage we have to enact these goals. Depending on the case and the forecast repercussions, countries will be convinced, bribed or subjugated by force to stop their ecological rampage.

We consider a certainty that when the time comes for the White race to rise once again, the current global political and economical status quo will be long gone already. The current world order will have fallen, be it due to wars,food crisis or due to population pressure. But wars with nuclear powers should only be waged in the moment when all others solutions have been attempted, as it will in all likelihood initiate the end times, global thermonuclear warfare of unprecedented scale with no other outcome beside the annihilation of the main global superpowers. All other solutions must be explored to limit the ecological damage, all ways of persuasion, alliances, bribing or economic warfare.

Only when the fate of the planet will be judged more endangered by letting the status quo continue, than by risking a full-on war, then must hostilities be initiated or encouraged.  The Imperium must strive to push its borders continuously, both for geopolitical and economical reasons (accessing resources, securing areas, putting a halt on environmental catastrophes), until the world doesn't have to fear the depredation of parasitic populations anymore.

In all of this, it is our spiritual powers that will win all conflicts: Perceiving the future on whatever level, when it comes to war, is the ultimate weapon to end all wars. Predicting the location of the enemy's hidden nuclear silos can limit collateral damages to the environment and good people to a minimum. That is why even on a practical level in order **to avoid a second Axis debacle**, future wars will be waged by honing our humanity.

## Religion

The future of Europe and humanity as a whole, calls for an elite of men and women with the mental fortitude to dedicate their body and mind to the service of the State, to recreate paradise on Earth. Compulsory education, military training and tightly controlled sexuality will bring our people to *the brink of transcendance*.

An in-depth, unbiased analysis of history shows without a doubt, that the most efficient and stable political model is the reunion of all powers in the same person: the Führer, the Emperor, the Pharaoh. In each case, a sacred ruler deemed of divine origin, and usually being attributed supernatural abilities. Rome was at its most powerful during the Empire, and before that saved itself several times by intrusting absolute power over all aspect of society, property, culture and religion, to dictators.

While solid institutions and administrative bodies are always a boon - as was the priest class in Ancient Egypt or the aristocracy in Venise. The emperor will take its authority not from the people, but from the gods, and trinkle it down the State as its life blood, binding every citizen to His service by a shared mission.
The difference between this regime and all those that preceded it, is that divine legitimacy will not be a privilege of the ruler, nor of any ruling or priestly class: Our science of relationships ensures that psychic powers even on a small, occasional level, are developped by **every person** sexually initiated by someone already in possession of them from the moment both practice the instinctive diet and embrace the new form of love with discipline.

So even one supremely inspired leader could spread the Gift to a multiple persons of immediately inferior ranks, which would spread it among their officiers, all the way down the social and military hierarchy up to the commoner, finally including the whole population, manifesting incredible and rare abilities which could never statistically show in a mere 60 mediums.

The most inspired and thus gifted psychics, with the most potent magical power, will raise to the most important positions. The nature of institutions and politics will be nothing like we ever saw, more akin to that of a hive with each person knowing precisely his position, role and purpose, not or not so much because he has been ordered so, but because the extrasensory gives him all the conviction and certitudes and general informations he needs for any particular task, singularly accelerating learning and harmony. In the span of a single generation raised in this worldview, what is in effect a collective consciousness of a truly immense scale will be born, along with a new magical world, something wondrous barely conceivable as yet.

Extremely powerful analogies can be found in the universe of Warhammer 40k and Dune. In the first, the Emperor of Humanity, a messianic semi-divine figure present since the beginning of history, waiting for the opportunity to guide humanity to make it realize its potential as a species both psychic and rational, **independent from the whims and irrational excesses of the chaotic perversions of instincts** plaguing humanity and leading it to a self-destruction of its own creation, be it by literal demons, or technology going out of control. The Emperor is called the **<q>New Man</q>**: showing to humanity what it's meant to be, awakening the Collective Unconscious to the conscious Level.

## Lifestyle

The State will have an immense educational role in getting rid of centuries to millennia old thinking habits. But changing the minds without changing diet first is nigh impossible with adults: only children can develop to their fullest extent and only if fed naturally and educated as intended from a tender age. Therefore, the absolute most urgent task is to renew agricultural practices toward the mass production of genetically compatible raw food, so that the whole people can have the means to practice as soon as possible.

```quote{author="Joseph Goebbels" .aside .important}
[Nuremberg, 1934](#)
Only an authoritarian government, firmly tied to a people, can lead the people over the long term.
```

Therefore the absolute most urgent inner political task is to revolutionize agricultural practices for everyone and start the mass production of genetically compatible raw food. History proved that questioning cooked food is for most people the most difficult thing to do, even when facing the certitude of death.

Then, the era of a new collectivist life will begin. The natural laws of love and diet will make of jealousy and the nuclear family a thing of the past, as the unconscious roots for these impulses no longer exist. As much as practically possible, people will live in habitats varying in kind, location and size, to please a wide range of aspiration and provide a wide range of experiences, over all the Imperium's territory. Mobility will be encouraged, to gather said experience. Work will be organized as locally as possible, thanks to high levels of automation and a reduced footprint.

The economy will be planified to allow the full deployment of the working population, at first toward the most immediate national goals. Private interests might persist for a time as conglomerates of industries tighly bound with the State and controlled by it, mirroring WW2's Italian and Japanese corporatism. Then quickly as goods of consommation become standarized and simplified, total communism on a racial and scientific basisthe sole purpose of life the satisfaction of the fundamental needs of love, sexuality, food and the conscious joyful improvement of the human mind and body.

	```quote{author="Teilhard de Chardin" cite="The Sense of the Species of Man, 1949"}
	From this there follows, as a first priority, a fundamental concern to ensure (by correct nutrition, by education, and by selection) an ever more advanced eugenics of the human zoological type on the surface of the earth. At the same time, however, and even more markedly, there must be an ever more intense effort directed towards discovery and vision, animated by the hope of our gradually, as one man, putting our hands on the deep-seated forces (physico-chemical, biological and psychic) which provide the impetus of evolution... There is no future for man, I repeat, without the neo-sense of the species.

[^tradition]: We are not against traditions nor against them, as they crystallize both people's unadulterated instincts and degenerate tendencies in any particular century: the correct attitude in this new century is to conserve the good elements and burn away the rest.

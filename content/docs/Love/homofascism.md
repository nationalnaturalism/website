description: "Why a strong ethnostate is not only compatible with the explosion of non-traditional sexuality, but *demands* it."
---

We are **homofascist**, we know by experience and. The strongest relationships, as demonstrated by both history and animal studies, are those directed at people of the same sex---homosexuality---and toward the **significantly** younger or older---pedophilia. Those are the main cultural ingredients to create the superior man (and woman) of tomorrow. We demonstrated the ubiquity of metasexual behaviors in [nature](meta#in-nature). This section illustrates and proves the truth of the pederastic model in Greek and Roman antiquity, its necessity for the future of humanity, and the place it really had in **Nazi Germany**.

## Classical antiquity

Ancient Greeks were famous for their love of prepubescent young boys representing the epitome of physical beauty. This however reflected a certain part of society, the higher classes, which inherited those values from aristocratic times. Pederasty was an ideal, and as such many people had many interpretations of it[^diverse].
In brief, pederasty was approved everywhere, but the passive role was *sometimes* shunned for adults. But currently a great many people opposed to the LGBT movement willingly throw the baby out with the bathwater, and lie about history, picturing them as unilaterally homophobic, an attitude universally unthinkable back then.

![homo_greek_quote](/Images/spirituality/citation_homo_greeks.webp)

Clearly distinct from the now prevalent or publicly acclaimed effeminate homosexuals transsexuals and other *psychiatric abominations*, have always stood the relationships practiced by the highest geniuses and warriors, the likes of Plato, Michelangelo, Achilles and Patroclus, Eugene of Savoy, Lord Byron, Goethe, Edgar Allan Poe, Casanova, Gajdusek, Sapho, Michael Ange, all ...
This approach and perception of love as a whole begets high cultures and eternal values wherever it blooms, in contrast to the self-centered hedonism of degenerate drug addicts and leftists making making the bulk of today’s homosexuals and wrongly called <q>pedophiles</q>.

```quote{.aside}
In Crete, in order for the suitor to carry out the ritual abduction, the father had to approve him as worthy of the honor. Among the Athenians, as Socrates claims in Xenophon's Symposium, <q>Nothing [of what concerns the boy] is kept hidden from the father, by an ideal lover</q>. In order to protect their sons from **inappropriate** attempts at seduction, fathers appointed slaves called pedagogues to watch over their sons. *However, according to Aeschines, Athenian fathers would pray that their sons would be handsome and attractive*, with the full knowledge that they would then attract the attention of men and <q>be the objects of fights because of erotic passions</q>.
```

The key being *ideal lover*. Prostitution - which is very distinct and pertains to *porneia*, the kind of love solely focused on using and abusing the body of others with spiritual motives whatsoever - was common too, for both sex. But free boys willingly prostituting oneself was repellent to most. 

Most people found homosexuality totally natural, even if they themselves did not necessarily partake in it... *Sophisticated people of a certain standing nearly all did*, and we sympathize. Commoners, while being of a much higher mean quality than in our times, relish a bit less in this kind of thing, but still a lot compared to today: in a society with a severe separation of sexes, the whole life (fortunately !) would favor same-sex attraction. Arguments that only aristocrats would indulge in boys' love are ridiculous, since, as Xenophon's Socrates said, <q>streets are full with people willing to oblige</q>. And all cities were similar in this regard: *pederasty has been highly favored in Greece for centuries, still in Roman and Christian times*.

![Antihomo fake greek quotes](/Images/meta/wrong_antihomo_quotes_greek.jpg "Fake reactionary propaganda")

So even though understanding the mystical, higher aspects of desire as explicit in the Symposium indeed was slim already in Plato's time, as evidenced by a number of critics of pederasty (although less than <q>specialists</q> of doubtful intelligence believe), same-sex attraction - of whatever degree of sophistication - obviously kept strong for a long, long time.
To hammer home this truth we find it useful to debunk a few myths rabid reactionaries peddle everywhere they can on the internet, multiplying like a cancer on Western culture, myths summarized in this meme. Point by point, I will either validate these quotes - and explain the context - or debunk them, if they appear - as half do - utterly wrong and misguided. The fruit of seething vagina-worshiping haters envying what they'll never have, true love, *the keys to heaven's gate*.

### Plato

Considering the amount of die-hard morons claiming Greeks or Plato did not condone homosexuality or practice sodomy, below is an (commentated) excerpt from his Symposium, showing that he did, clearly refers to sexualilty explicitly.
He outlines the the same dichotomy of a heavenly, mystical pederasty vs reproductive heterosexuality, and the real purpose of **sexuality** and affection is to develop the extrasensory, the connection to the realm of souls beyond the material plane.

On a side note, it is interesting to know for Mr Burger discovering that Plato straight up taught metapsychoanalysis in 500 BC, occurred in prison, **before** the core of the theory (two distinct sexual instinctive programs) After this, we will see about the Republic and Laws, which contrast harshly against any previous works, and baffled the understanding of Western and antique critics alike. We, on the other hand, understood. All this, accounting for the inordinate place this author takes in our thoughts.

```quote{author="Plato", cite="Symposium"}
- Then if this be the nature of love, can you tell me further, she said,  **What is the manner of the pursuit? What are they doing who show all this eagerness and heat which is called love? And what is the object which they have in view?** Answer me.
- Nay, Diotima, I replied, if I had known, I should not have wondered at your wisdom, nor should I have come to learn from you about this very matter. Well, she said, **I will teach you:-The object which they have in view is birth in beauty, whether of body or soul.** I do not understand you, I said; the oracle requires an explanation.
- I will make my meaning dearer, she replied. I mean to say that all men are bringing to the birth in their bodies and in their souls. **There is a certain age at which human nature is desirous of procreation-procreation which must be in beauty and not in deformity; and this procreation is the union of man and woman**, and is a divine thing; for conception and generation are an immortal principle in the mortal creature, and in the inharmonious they can never be. But the deformed is always inharmonious with the divine, and the beautiful harmonious. Beauty, then, is the destiny or goddess of parturition who presides at birth, and therefore, when approaching beauty, the conceiving power is propitious, and diffusive, and benign, and begets and bears fruit: at the sight of ugliness she frowns and contracts and has a sense of pain, and turns away, and shrivels up, and not without a pang refrains from conception. And this is the reason why, when the hour of conception arrives, and the teeming nature is full, there is such a flutter and ecstasy about beauty whose approach is the alleviation of the pain of travail. For love, Socrates, is not, as you imagine, the love of the beautiful only.
- What then?
- The love of generation and of birth in beauty.
- Yes, I said.
- Yes, indeed, she replied. **But why of generation? Because to the mortal creature, generation is a sort of eternity and immortality, she replied; and if, as has been already admitted, love is of the everlasting possession of the good, all men will necessarily desire immortality together with good: Wherefore love is of immortality.**
[...](#)
- I want a teacher; tell me then the cause of this and of the other mysteries of love.
- Marvel not, she said, if you believe that love is of the immortal, as we have several times acknowledged; for here again, and on the same principle too, **the mortal nature is seeking as far as is possible to be everlasting and immortal: and this is only to be attained by generation, because generation always leaves behind a new existence in the place of the old.**[...](#)
For what is implied in the word <q>recollection</q> but the departure of knowledge, which is ever being forgotten, and is renewed and preserved by recollection, and appears to be the same although in reality new, according to that law of succession by which all mortal things are preserved, not absolutely the same, but by substitution, the old worn-out mortality leaving another new and similar existence behind unlike the divine, which is always the same and not another? And in this way, **Socrates, the mortal body, or mortal anything, partakes of immortality; but the immortal in another way. Marvel not then at the love which all men have of their offspring; for that universal love and interest is for the sake of immortality**.
```
```quote
This was a fake form of immortality, still prone to eternal change and decay, barely an approximation of the true one, the immortality of the soul, mostly carried by inspired, pederastic relationships (I prefer this term as even [Greeks would see more to it than "homosexuality"](.#girl_sodomy):

I was astonished at her words, and said:
- Is this really true, O thou wise Diotima?"

And she answered with all the authority of an accomplished sophist:
- Of that, Socrates, you may be assured; think only of the ambition of men, and you will wonder at the senselessness of their ways, **unless you consider how they are stirred by the love of an immortality of fame. They are ready to run all risks greater far than they would have for their children, and to spend money and undergo any sort of toil, and even to die, for the sake of leaving behind them a name which shall be eternal.** Do you imagine that Alcestis would have died to save Admetus, or Achilles to avenge Patroclus, or your own Codrus in order to preserve the kingdom for his sons, if they had not imagined that the memory of their virtues, which still survives among us, would be immortal? Nay, she said, I am persuaded that **all men do all things**, and the better they are the more they do them, in hope of the glorious fame of immortal virtue; **for they desire the immortal**.
```
The two kinds of love, though not really incompatible - all Greeks had a wife - do not compare in their effectiveness. Breeding is an inferior kind of love as the children of the body die while the children of the soul go on forever, alive in the minds of everyone thousands of years after world-wide, long past the boundary or life expectancy of one's bloodline.
{#diotime}
```quote
- *Those who are pregnant in the body only, betake themselves to women and beget children* - this is the character of their love; their offspring, as they hope, will preserve their memory and give them the blessedness and immortality which they desire in the future. But souls which are pregnant-for there certainly are men who are more creative in their souls than in their bodies, conceiving that which is proper for the soul to conceive or contain.
- And what are these conceptions? 
- Wisdom and virtue in general. And such creators are poets and all artists who are deserving of the name inventor. **But the greatest and fairest sort of wisdom by far is that which is concerned with the ordering of states and families**, and which is called temperance and justice. And **he who in youth has the seed of these implanted in him and is himself inspired, when he comes to maturity desires to beget and generate**. He wanders about seeking beauty that he may beget offspring-for in deformity he will beget nothing-and **naturally embraces the beautiful rather than the deformed body; above all when he finds fair and noble and well-nurtured soul**, ***he embraces the two in one person***, and *to such an one he is full of speech about virtue and the nature and pursuits of a _good man_; and he tries to educate him*; and at the touch of the beautiful which is ever present to his memory, even when absent, he brings forth that which he had conceived long before, and in company with him tends that which he brings forth; and **they are married by a far nearer tie and have a closer friendship than those who beget mortal children, for the children who are their common offspring are fairer and more immortal**. Who, when he thinks of Homer and Hesiod and other great poets, would not rather have their children than ordinary human ones? Who would not emulate them in the creation of children such as theirs, which have preserved their memory and given them everlasting glory? Or who would not have such children as Lycurgus left behind him to be the saviors, not only of Lacedaemon, but of Hellas, as one may say? There is Solon, too, who is the revered father of Athenian laws; and many others there are in many other places, both among hellenes and barbarians, **who have given to the world many noble works, and have been the parents of virtue of every kind; and many temples have been raised in their honor for the sake of children such as theirs; which were never raised in honor of any one, for the sake of his mortal children**.
```
At last, Plato lays out what this way of love actually look like, on a social level:
```quote{cite="idem"}
**For he who would proceed aright in this matter should begin in youth to visit beautiful forms**; and first, if he be **guided by his instructor aright, to love one such form only** - out of that he should create fair thoughts; and **soon he will himself perceive that the beauty of one form is akin to the beauty of another; and then if beauty of form in general is his pursuit, how foolish would he be not to recognize that the beauty in every form is the same!**

And when he perceives this he will abate his violent love of the one, which he will despise and deem a small thing, and **will become a lover of all beautiful forms**; in the **next stage he will consider that the beauty of the mind is more honorable than the beauty of the outward form. So that if a virtuous soul have but a little comeliness, he will be content to love and tend him**, and will search out and bring to the birth thoughts which may improve the young, **until he is compelled to contemplate and see the beauty of institutions and laws, and to understand that the beauty of them all is of one family, and that personal beauty is a trifle; and after laws and institutions he will go on to the sciences**, that he may see their beauty, being not like a servant in love with the beauty of one youth or man or institution, himself a slave mean and narrow-minded, but drawing towards and contemplating the vast sea of beauty, he will create many fair and noble thoughts and notions in boundless love of wisdom; until on that shore he grows and waxes strong, and at last the vision is revealed to him of a single science, which is the science of beauty everywhere. To this I will proceed; please to give me your very best attention: 
```
The following resumes the whole exposition: from one beautiful body to many, from one beautiful soul to many, then to divine essence beauty itself. The text is clear in its inclusion of sexuality. But love of physical beauty (the violent passion for one body) *is but one step, a means to connect on a deeper level than just the body or the emotion.* That last subtlety, I think, has gone above the head of most readers (even very intelligent ones) so far. Individual passions in general do not matter.
> He who from these ascending under the influence of true love, begins to perceive that beauty is not far from the end. And the true order of going, or being led by another, to the things of love, is to **begin from the beauties of earth and mount upwards for the sake of that other beauty, using these as steps only, and from one going on to two, and from two to all fair forms, and from fair forms to fair practices, and from fair practices to fair notions, until from fair notions he arrives at the notion of absolute beauty, and at last knows what the essence of beauty is. This, my dear Socrates, said the stranger of Mantineia, is that life above all others which man should live, in the contemplation of beauty absolute**

How anyone, even pederasts, can conclude Socrates thought sex as <q>lowly</q> or unfit from this same dialog, will always leave me aghast.

Pretty much the same discourse occurs in *Phaedrus*, a pederastic relationship should not be used for sexual pleasure but to reach the divine. *He also ridicules the notion that an adequate lover should have no feelings*... **Nowhere** does he criticize sex in itself.

Yet it became mainstream to say this:
```quote{cite="Wikipedia"}
Notably, Socrates sees the pederastic relationship as ideally devoid of sexual consummation; rather than being used for sexual pleasure, the relationship is a form of divine madness, helping both lover and beloved to grow and reach the divine.  
```
They argue like this:
> And yet, this is tempered in various ways; role reversals between lover and beloved are constant, as they are in the Symposium. Socrates, ostensibly the lover, exhorts Phaedrus to lead the way at various times, and the dialogue ends with Socrates and Phaedrus leaving as "friends": equals, rather than partaking in the lover/beloved relationship inherent in Greek pederasty. In the beginning, they sit themselves under a chaste tree, which is precisely what its name suggests—often known as "monk's pepper", it was used by monks to decrease sexual urges and is believed to be an antaphrodisiac.

Socrates here promotes a more appeased approach not consumed by **passion**, touchings are not the issue, they should be an ornament to something that goes deeper. As a divine madness what we do when possessed by love is beyond good and evil, otherwise to suggest it is bad per se would amount to blasphemy, even though Plato constantly talks of being willing slaves of the gods.

Now onto Republic, his.
```quote{cite="Republic, 636c", author="Plato"}
It's contrary to nature
```

First off, this is wrong, there is no 636c in Republic, which ends at 621d. Hence the criminally stupid author of that hateful claim, should be given the choice of dying mauled by a tiger or crushed by raging elephants... That quote is from *Laws*, to which we will come afterwards.

```quote{cite="Republic, 404"}
- Can you tell of a greater or keener pleasure than the one connected with sex?
- I can’t, he said, nor a madder one either.
- Is the naturally right kind of love to love in a moderate and musical way what’s orderly and fine?
- Quite so, he said.
- Nothing that’s mad or akin to licentiousness must approach the right kind of love?
- No, it must't.
- Then this pleasure mustn’t approach love, and lover and boy who love and are loved in the right way mustn’t be partner to it?b
- By Zeus, no, Socrates, he said, this pleasure certainly mustn’t approach love.
```

Plato is literally proposing the end of all sexual pleasure whatsoever. Anything moving spirits even slightly above the normal should be forbidden, until we all become perfect philosopher **robots**. This was written at most in 375 BCE according to criticisms while *Symposium* was written between 385 to 370 at the earliest. And it's nothing compared to *Laws*, the most loathed of his works.
*Those two works contradict each other*. One talks of divine folly and uranian **desire** growing the wings of the soul, developing extrasensory perception, political and artistic qualities, when the other **bans** all desire and pleasure. There is nothing grand, nothing inspired nor making much sense in *Republic* anymore, hardly anything a man of reason would consider neither realistic nor desirable, such as the proposition to cut any and all family ties, not knowing one's relatives in order to identify to the whole community. The idea of regimenting every single aspect of life, stifling and drying up any possible source of creativity. Yet, as this chart below shows, this work came before the development of the Academy ?

Why would Plato teach something already completely at odds with its former works, both in tone and content ? What was he even teaching, what have people like Aristotle come to believe as the true doctrine of their master, accessing divinity through mystical pederastic sex ?

Or being scared of losing your marbles with any strong human feeling and avoiding any human experiences and connections, including with your family to live like an abstinent Christian monk (even monks might have had homosexuality running high in their convent) ? How did his students react, or the people at large ? If people didn't understand anything (most of them surely didn't), why was the point of running his Academy for years until his death ? *None of it makes sense*, except believing he lost faith in everything he held dear before. What could have changed him if he did change, is unknown. In Athens, he experienced the rule of the 30, an oligarchic clique put in charge of Athens by Sparta after its victory. They tried to seduce Plato and Socrates, given both were sympathizers of Lacedemon. But to know what exactly happened with the Thirty is difficult to say the least.[^thirty]

Then he had a bad experience with Denys 1er de Syracuse, tyrant de Sicile, in 387, which invited him to then dismiss him in the most arbitrary manner, even (as the tradition goes) being responsible for his capture as a slave (fortunately a short experience). Then he wrote the Republic and Symposium, in the same span of time. So assuming a specific event changed his view doesn't fit the [chronology](https://www.csun.edu/~hcfll004/platochron.html "PLATONIC CHRONOLOGY and WRITINGS -- California State University, Northridge"). Now onto Laws, his last work, and oh boy we are in for a ride on a sea of pure batshit insanity:

```quote
### Correct procreation:

The topic which should come after marriage, and before training and education, is the birth of children.

ATHENIAN: The three impulses we distinguish by our three terms: the desire for ‘food’ (I think we said) and ‘drink’, and thirdly ‘sexual stimulation’.

CLEINIAS: Yes, sir, we’ll certainly remember, just as you tell us.

ATHENIAN: Splendid. Let’s turn our attention to the bridal pair, and instruct them in the manner and method by which they should produce children. **(And if we fail to persuade them, we’ll threaten them with a law or two.)**

[...](#)

If children come in suitable numbers, the period of *supervised procreation* should be *ten years and no longer*. But **if a couple remain childless throughout this period, they should part**.

The female officials must enter the homes of the young people and by a _combination of admonition and **threats**_ try to make them give up their ignorant and sinful ways.
[...](#) he [the sinful non-breeder](#) must be deprived of the privilege of attending weddings and parties celebrating the birth of children. If he persists in attending, *anyone who wishes should chastise him by beating him, and not be punished for it*. If a woman misbehaves and her name is posted up [...](#) the same regulations are to apply to her too[...](#) 

After the period of child-bearing, the _**chaste man or woman** should be highly respected_;
the *promiscuous should be held in the opposite kind of ‘repute’* (though disrepute would be a better word).
```

> Naturally enough, I began to feel some disquiet. I wondered how one would handle a state like this, with everyone engaged on a life-long round of sacrifices and festivals and chorus-performances,

No science, no wonder, no discovery, no innovation, no meditation. Just war, theater, eating, sleeping and breeding. **Yes, only breeding**. No romance, no pleasure, no soul, just **breeding**. And if a couple refuses to spend all their seed breeding, **VLAM**. What on Earth could explain such an obvious cataclysmic shift ?

```quote
the fact that though in several other respects Crete in general and Sparta give us pretty solid help when we frame laws that flout common custom, in affairs of the heart (there’s no one listening, so let’s be frank) *they are totally opposed to us*. Suppose you follow nature’s rule and establish the law that was in force before the time of Laius [regarded as the first homosexual... before Zeus himself though ?](#)  You’d argue that one may have sexual intercourse with a woman but not with men or boys. As evidence for your view, you’d point to the animal world, where (you’d argue) the males do not have sexual relations with each other, because such a thing is unnatural.

[...](#)However,another argument is that such practices are incompatible with what in our view should be the constant aim of the legislator – that is, we’re always asking ‘which of our regulations encourages virtue, and which does not?’[...](#)

What contribution would they[homosexuals](#) make to virtue?
Will the spirit of courage spring to life in the soul of the seduced person?
Will the soul of the seducer learn habits of self-control? No one is going to be led astray by that sort of argument – quite the contrary. Everyone [e] will censure the weakling who yields to temptation, and condemn his all-too-effeminate partner who plays the role of the woman.
```

This contradicts everything he ever wrote, that is to say the universally agreed notion in the whole Mediterranean, that pederasty did engender all those qualities via emulation (from a lowly worldly point of view) and divine inspiration (from an orphic/mystical one). Here he simply erases the metapsychic plane of love from consideration. If only marginally, anyone who observes farm animals **does** notice homosexual intercourses.

> When the legislator wants to tame one of the desires that dominate mankind so cruelly, it’s easy for him to see his method of attack. He must try to make everyone – slave and free, women and children, and the entire state without any exception – believe that this common opinion has the backing of religion. He couldn’t put his law on a securer foundation than that.

People are cattle who can't understand anything: *give them made-up religious fear*.

> Athenian: I’m glad you’ve taken me up on the point. This is just what I was getting at when I said I knew of a way to put into effect this law of ours which permits the sexual act only for its natural purpose, procreation, and forbids not only homosexual relations, in which *the human race is deliberately murdered*, but also the sowing of seeds on rocks and stone, where it will never take root and mature into a new individual;

No fellatio, no masturbation, only the penis in a holy fertile vagina, **no sex outside fertile wombs, oy vey !**
It is important to realize that this kind of discourse was by all means *absolutely unheard off in Greek Antiquity*. This was no evidence of modern social conservatism, but for most people of mental insanity. The notion that sterile sexual contacts would endanger a city would have left any Greek **flabbergasted**, considering they chronically suffered from **overpopulation**[^overpopulation] 

We do not claim this text is apography or a fake, but the difference with earlier works (and striking resemblance to the Jewish Bible) indicates something extremely weird happened, which easily led true platonist with an inkling of sensibility to Love and Essences, to disregard it as a patent outlier. But we do claim that:
- either Plato did a complete U turn and became actually mentally insane: an unlikely turn of event since he also wrote Timaeus and Critias at the same time pointing a good deal of inspiration
- or *fell out of love with the world at large, perceiving what it would turn into, and wanting none of it.* And decided to pastiche himself out of spite, offering a mirror of what truly *underlied* people's incomprehension of the sacred Éros: a rampant materialism and rationalism which only grew stronger with time, *as evidenced by his own pupil Aristotle, as spiritually dry as a bone*.

Already the *Republic* ironized constantly, suggesting outlandish solutions to imaginary issues. But the tone was still light enough not derailing too much from the usual. _Laws however looks like the final <q>F\*\*ck U!</q> of a man who had lost faith in humanity_, due to many bad experiences accumulating, least and not last Socrates' execution and his tragic involvement with Dion and Denys the Young, the latter to whom many roasting comments in Laws were addressed to. If anyone could have had a vision of the future in the literal sense, it would have been Plato.

Regardless, to claim that Plato refused homosexuality is beside the point, he refused **all** sexual pleasure whatsoever and anything not strictly reproductive even within a heterosexual context, an attitude most hardcore Islamists would find grossly abusive. *While praising mystical homo sex in other books*.

This conception of love and spirituality was not a production of Plato's mind... either out of foolishness or genuine intuition. It is clear how it was shared by many, if not most Greeks to some level. Not everyone was fond of young boys, some preferred prostitutes or girls. Like Aristophanes. Yet, <q>boy-lover</q> was not an insult. Much less than when people used to say about Julius Caesar (much later) <q>he is the man of all women and the woman of all men</q>, and yet it was not an insult at all either, more like a praise... more on that later.

![chad](/Images/memes/yes_gay_chad.webp)

According to all reports, up to the rise of Alexander the Great, Sparta was unanimously recognized as an **ideal, collectivist eugenist and sex-positive White ethnostate**, ripe with eugenicist and a near-complete abiding by natural instincts, all leading to a superior intellect and boundless martial might which left the whole Mediterranean world in awe for centuries. And a high place of pederasty, so much so that it pervaded heterosexuality, and women themselves would often take under their wings younger girls in the same fashion as was customary for boys and older men in the rest of Greece. 
The whole written tradition - including Xenophon - describe it as **the epitome of spiritually-minded institutionalized pederasty**, so much so that <q>to lakonize</q> was **synonymous of sodomy**. We aim at imitating it, plus incest and raw food, to create the psychosexual foundations for a culture lasting forever.

### Other Greek authors

#### Xenophon

Perhaps the most "negative" testimony (regards to our tenets) **would be Xenophon's**, who unlike most writers had a first hand knowledge of Sparta and sent his kids to be educated there. It comes from *Constitution of the Lacedaimonians*[^Lacedemonian]. But the translation used to scorn same-sex love is *horse dung*. The original Greek however tells a different story, that people with no sense for that language's subtlety overlook.

> εἰ δέ τις παιδὸς σώματος ὀρεγόμενος φανείη, αἴσχιστον τοῦτο θεὶς ἐποίησεν ἐν Λακεδαίμονι μηδὲν ἧττον ἐραστὰς παιδικῶν ἀπέχεσθαι ἢ γονεῖς παίδων καὶ ἀδελφοὶ ἀδελφῶν εἰς ἀφροδίσια ἀπέχονται.
> If it was clear that [this attraction](#) **resided** in the boy's body, **shameful** in Sparta and [he](#) caused **inferior** lovers to ...
{.aside}

In reality the ban on sex is textually applying only to lovers <q>whose attraction resides in the boy's body</q>, a sentence that should be beyond any ambiguity already. But we have become idiots incapable to fathom a physical desire rooted in more than mere physical qualities, but in something beyond, namely someone's soul. The most important word was omitted in the two most widespread translations: ἧττον, masculine nominative singular form and comparative of the comparative of ἥσσων, meaning <q>lesser</q> or <q>inferior</q>, with *ἧττον ἐραστὰς* meaning <q>inferior lovers</q>. So Lycurge caused inferior lovers to back off from kids. Not **all** lovers.

This kind of law or customs testifies of a **reflects a superior inspiration**. The metasexual program do have preferred physical forms - *triggering patterns* - purity, innocence and subtle traits indicative of <q>inner beauty</q> in lack of another term - quite distinct from those of the reproductive program, but also differing a lot in its modalities.

In an instant, depending on both the lover's and loved one's inner attitude, perception can switch from pleasing to appalling, for the same body, when physical contact would be detrimental to energy. This contrasts to the reproductive program, because it doesn't care if the stallion or mare has an horrible character and hates your guts, as his dick or big muscles (or big boobs and ass respectively) hint at the same hereditary qualities which the offspring might profit from.
*Fucking* is only concerned with the body while *loving* as humans are meant to do, only sees bodily traits as facilitators for an exchange of a higher nature than mere bodily fluids. The Greek is **not** <q>attraction to a boy's beauty is abomination</q> and those liars deserves whipping, if not rape by highly muscular men. 

```quote{author="Xenophon", cite="Memorabilia, book I, section 2 ¶30-31"}
Nevertheless, although he was himself free from vice, if he saw and approved of base conduct in them, he would be open to censure. Well, when he found that Critias loved Euthydemus and wanted to lead him astray, *he tried to restrain him by saying that it was mean and unbecoming in a gentleman to sue like a beggar to the object of his affection, whose good opinion he coveted, stooping to ask a favor that it was wrong to grant*.

As Critias paid no heed whatever to this protest, Socrates, it is said, exclaimed in the presence of Euthydemus and many others, <q>Critias seems to have the feelings of a pig: he can no more keep away from Euthydemus than pigs can help rubbing themselves against stones.</q>
```
Here is another quote misconstrued as Socrates spitting on pederasts. But what he criticizes in this excerpt is obvious: the absence of self-control, effectively giving the man's impulses lowly animal traits. A man should be the object of admiration from his loved one, show the way to virtue, not beg for approval like a faggot... or a female. **This had nothing to do with homosexuality per se.** Here's another such quote, from Xenophon's symposium seemingly relating the same events:

```quote
- Now, whether there is one Aphrodite or two, <q>Heavenly</q> and <q>Vulgar</q>, I do not know; for even Zeus, though considered one and the same, yet has many by-names. I do know, however, that in the case of Aphrodite there are separate altars and temples for the two, and also rituals, those of the <q>Vulgar</q> Aphrodite excelling in looseness, those of the <q>Heavenly</q> in chastity. One might conjecture, also, that different types of love come from the different sources, carnal love from the <q>Vulgar</q> Aphrodite, and from the <q>Heavenly</q> spiritual love, love of friendship and of noble conduct. That is the sort of love, Callias, that seems to have you in its grip. I infer this from the noble nature of the one you love and because I see that you include his father in your meetings with him. *For the virtuous lover does not make any of these matters a secret from the father of his beloved*.
- Marry, quoth Hermogenes, you arouse my admiration in numerous ways, Socrates, but now more than ever, because in the very act of flattering Callias you are in fact educating him to conform to the ideal.
- True, he replied; and to add to his pleasure, I wish to bear testimony to him that spiritual love is far superior to carnal. 
```

There is no reason to believe Callias would refrain from intercourse, as both love are written as *έρως*, sexual desire. This notion of two Aphrodites and the term describing the good pederasty (*uranian* έρως) is the exact same found in Plato's Symposium, while the vulgar (*pandemonian* Aphrodite) is a mindless form of desire personified by... prostitutes and married women. *Carnal* doesn't mean physical, but **only or mainly** lying in the physical.
The difference between Plato and Xenophon, really appeared to be minimal on this topic. That coincides with Athenians father both protecting their boys and prompting them to attract **proper** men.

The main romantic interest of **most** men (not all, obviously) were (pre)/adolescent boys, because younger children on many levels have no defined gender before puberty kicks in. That moment at the onset of puberty is *the last moment to initiate a child and develop the metapsychical program, or else breeding (with or without contraception) becomes the dominant sensibility*, and the child loses track of his destiny for good. At least it is the case now, but before age seven---the age of reason---kids would stay with women, then in many primitive societies boys would integrate into the men' group. So in Sparta for boys the agoge or formal educational system started at 7 while girls usually stayed with the women' group. **Nowhere** has Xenophon in whole literary corpus ever emitted any criticism of pederasty.[^Hindley]

#### Alexander the Great

How is **this** **not** gay ?
```quote{cite="Alexander 67.7–8", author="Plutarch"}
When he reached the royal palace of Gedrosia, Alexander once again gave the army some recreation by arranging a festival. [8] The story goes that he was drunk while watching some dancing competitions, and that Bagoas, whose lover he was, won a dancing-prize, came through the theater in his finery and seated himself next to the king. Seeing this, they say, the Macedonians clapped in applause and loudly called for Alexander to kiss him, until eventually the king took him in his arms and gave him a kiss.
```

As for his fake quote: I defer to this insightful commentary. The point is, he didn't want to force or coerce anyone or profit from his position to deprive someone of their dignity. Not that he wasn't into boys.

```quote{cite="[Personal relationships of Alexander the Great](https://www.indiaforums.com/forum/topic/4986747)"}
Alexander III of Macedon was admired during his lifetime for treating all his lovers humanely. Plutarch has argued that Alexander's love of males took an ethical approach, inspired by the teachings of his mentor, Aristotle. He gives several examples of Alexander's morality in this domain:
> When Philoxenus, the leader of the seashore, wrote to Alexander that there was a youth in Ionia whose beauty has yet to be seen and asked him in a letter if he (Alexander) would like him (the boy) to be sent over, he (Alexander) responded in a strict and disgusted manner: You are the most hideous and malign of all men, have you ever seen me involved in such dirty (sexual) work that you found the urge to flatter me with such **hedonistic** business ?

Plutarch also wrote:
> When Philoxenus, the commander of his forces on the seaboard, wrote that there was with him a certain Theodorus of Tarentum, who had two youths of surpassing *beauty to sell*, and inquired whether Alexander would buy them, Alexander was incensed, and cried out many times to his friends, asking them what shameful thing Philoxenus had ever seen in him that he should spend his time in making *such disgraceful proposals*.

Plutarch's claims of Alexanders moral approach towards sexual relations also extended to prisoners of war:
> But as for the other captive women, seeing that they were surpassingly stately and beautiful, he merely said jestingly that ancient Persians were mysteriously beautiful beings. He describes the Persian women as torments to the eyes. And displaying in rivalry with their fair looks the beauty of his own sobriety and self-control, he passed them by as though they were lifeless images for display.

The above quotations would be in line with the thoughts laid about before him by Aristotle, *who regarded relationships based **purely on carnal relations** to be shameful*. Not wanting to use captured prisoners as sex slaves would rather show Alexander's general disinterest in these women. Alexander did however keep a beautiful Persian boy in his stable of lovers.
```

#### Aristophanes

```quote{cite="Thesmophoriazusae" author="Aristophanes"}
They are given to unnatural lust.
```

Well those words are not present in my translation. The term <q>unnatural</q> didn't exist, and the its concept just alluded to in *Laws*. While the idea of a natural order exists, to label people as *wicked* from deviancy alone regardless of actual harm to society or individuals, was simply a level of normativity non-existent before Judeo-christianity.
However, Aristophanes was a notorious opponent of pederasty, who built his fame by making his public of tens of thousands of well-bred Athenian males of all ages laugh, by accusing them of what a lot of *adult* men were complicit in the passive role. Homosexuality by default implied a sodomy, which requires a passive partner, but both partners would be free citizens. So supposing public morale usually looked down upon passivity, _this couldn't possibly a monolithic judgment, as all adult men doing the sodomizing by default had been <q>tutored</q> by an adult man while younger, and thus, **penetrated**._
In Greek and even more Roman society the distinction between effeminacy and passivity has always been vague, I would argue properly *schizophrenic*. I would argue the more cooking developed and the less grip public institutions had on the collective, the more the ambiguity would take hold. This is why a very strong collectivistic culture is necessary with our lifestyle, and why Sparta kept its edge longer.

#### Aeso

```quote{author="Aeso", cite="Zeus and Shame"}
They have no sense of shame</q> (Zeus and Shame))
```

Judging from their medieval latin adaptation, these fables written by a former Greek slave in the late to mid-6th century BCE were a collection of subversive and vulgar tales full of sex with whoever and whatever the ugly Aesop had at its disposal. Representing somewhat of a counter-culture, this might explain why the mythical author (which most likely never existed, like Homer himself) has been imagined as a slave by a few Greek historians.
Regardless of some written disparaging discourses, it would not have made any sense for a young aspiring citizen in a very public relationship, to publically hide his being penetrated (or for others to seriously mock him for it), *since he was expected to*. Slight taunts do prove a state of moral ambiguity, but they constitute totally justified Excalibur impulses, which, when not going overboard (as it happened *relatively more* with Romans), hone the strength of character:
People who practice sodomy for pleasure only - as one would fuck a prostitute - would resent the taunt, feel shame and reconsider their attitude. While those sure of their moral probity and spirituality elevation of their sexuality, would not feel concerned in the slightest. Explaining thus, what would otherwise look like institutionalized hypocrisy, to berate something yet indulge in it publically, and expect every male to.

This double-discours attitude survived in the Middle Age despite nominally much sterner admonitions and theological implications, although with as little actual condemnations.

#### Aeschines

**Then to Aeschines:**
```quote{cite="Against Timarchus", author="Aeschines"}
[137](#) *to hire for money and to indulge in licentiousness is the act of a man who is wanton and ill-bred*.
```

Which implies precisely nothing about homosexuality. But the **complete** quote says more, *positively so*:

```quote{cite="Against Timarchus", author="Aeschines"}
[136](#) Now as for me, *I neither find fault with love that is honorable*, nor do I say that those who surpass in beauty are prostitutes. I do not deny that I myself have been a lover and am a lover to this day [...](#) 

[137](#) The distinction which I draw is this: to be in love with those who are beautiful and chaste is the experience of a kind-hearted and generous soul; but *to hire for money and to indulge in licentiousness is the act of a man who is wanton and ill-bred*. And whereas it is an honor to be the object of a pure love, *I declare that he who has played the prostitute by inducement of wages is disgraced*.[...](#)

[139](#) the same lawgiver said, “A slave shall not be the lover of a free boy nor follow after him, or else he shall receive fifty blows of the public lash.” But the free man was not forbidden to love a boy, and associate with him, and follow after him, nor did the lawgiver think that harm came to the boy thereby, but rather that such a thing was a testimony to his chastity. But, I think, so long as the boy is not his own master and is as yet unable to discern who is a genuine friend, and who is not, the law teaches the lover self-control, and makes him defer the words of friendship till the other is older and has reached years of discretion; but to follow after the boy and to watch over him the lawgiver regarded as the best possible safeguard and protection for chastity.
```
Aeschines describes himself as a lover, in this context a **pederast**, and that it is honorable, and says that slaves - people who do not own themselves hence can't be relied on nor be expected to act honorably - can not free men for that love can not be free. While prostitution is legal for this reason it is **immorale**, but a free man and a free boy can love each other freely, with the only restriction as the former should exert <q>self-restraint</q> when the latter hasn't reached 11 or so. Although even this is relative, as there was no law against proper pedophilia, if parents would agree. And people considered the **stalking** by an adult of good repute as a protection...

#### Aristotle

```quote{cite="Nicomachean ethics", author="Aristotle"}
The pathological kind may result either from people’s nature or from habituation. I mean things like … pulling your hair out … biting your nails … eating charcoal, or clay [likely a reference to pregnancy cravings, or pica more generally. Both of these particular cravings are known in pregnant women](#)… **and, we might add, female sexuality in males**. Because in some people those things arise from their nature, in others from habituation, i.e. when they’re trained into them from childhood. So in all cases where the cause is their nature, nobody would speak of them ‘not being able to control’ [those urges] (just as you wouldn’t say women ‘lack self-control’ for having the non-penetrative role sexually), and the same goes for any pathological states that result from habituation.
```

He thus equates being penetrated anally (which was but a part of male-male sexuality, even though a good one) with either a deviation from nature or something bred by habit. In both cases putting in the same category as biting your nail or eating charcoal (which is actually healthy), things devoid of moral taint and not really bothersome either. I defer to the translator's note:

```quote
"Female sexuality in males": The manuscript text here contains an ungrammatical fragment, usually loosely rendered as ‘sex with men’.

It can only mean that in **pig-Greek**. 
{.important}

Greek attitudes to homosexuality were complex. Many cities, including Athens, tolerated relationships between an older ‘lover’ (the erastes) and younger, late-adolescent ‘boyfriend’ (the paidika or erōmenos). [A] discusses those relationships as if they were commonplace and normal (see e.g. VIII.4 and IX.1). But the relationships had rules: the younger men were not expected to stay in them into manhood. Also, the younger man – who played the quasi-feminine role – *was supposed to be the sexually passive partner*. Older men who were passive sexual partners (in that sense) throughout their lives were considered unusual, and teased with accusations of ‘effeminacy’ and ‘softness’. (There are various graphic terms of abuse for men known for having those tastes, preserved by Aristophanes.)
Given these cultural facts, and the physiologically explicit remark about women that follows, and [A]’s attitudes elsewhere, we can be certain that he was not referring here to homosexuality in general or to the cultural practice of the erastes/erōmenos relationship in general (‘pederasty’, as R wrongly translates), but to sexual passivity (i.e. a preference for being penetrated) in (older) men.

Victorian scholars, because of their own attitudes, took A’s phrase ‘outside the bounds of being a bad person’ (which means ‘something it makes no sense to regard as morally bad’) to mean ‘beyond depraved’, i.e. unspeakably evil – *pretty much the exact opposite of its actual sense*. Note that A says that God is outside the bounds of badness, too, at 1145a26.
[A]’s treatment in fact has elements of defense. Some men have female sexual tastes, he says, and it makes no more sense to criticize them for those, or accuse them of ‘not controlling themselves’, than it does to criticize women for the same. And notice that he appears to place such tastes on a moral par with biting your fingernails and pregnancy cravings.
A key Peripatetic text to compare here is Problems 879a36. There the question is raised, ‘Why do some men enjoy the passive sexual role?’ There is no hint of condemnation. But A – or whoever the author is – does say, as here, that the natural version of the condition is a ‘physical impairment’ that ‘distorts’ reproductive functioning. The terms are biological, not moral.
```
For Aristotle, not really the most spiritually aware Greek author, being the bottom did raise some suspicion of effeminacy but was not strictly equivalent to effeminacy, or <q>female sexuality in men</q>, or it would have been call **faggots** a whole lot of old(er) well-bred men. Again, sexuality was a trivial matter in Greece, *you could do mostly whatever you wanted with however, as long as you didn't touch the property of others*. Even touching your relatives was strictly speaking your business, with only consequence at worst as far as literary records are concerned, was eventually being kicked out of a few social circles. Simply put, not all faggots are passive, and not all men who enjoy passivity are faggots. Now, or back then, and while they lacked the psychoanalytic tools to discern with exact accuracy, the ambiguity featured in literature attests of such an unconscious knowledge. *Even here Aristotle does not insinuate such men with <q>female sexuality</q> have moral issues, lack courage or virility in life etc*.

Also Aristotle:
> Why is it that some men enjoy being the passive partner in the sexual act, and some of these also find pleasure in taking an active role, but others do not? *Those in whom the semen travels to the anus desire to be passive in the sexual act, those in whom the semen travels to both places to be both active and passive. In whichever place there is more fluid they desire more friction*. In some men this disposition arises from habit. For men do whatever happens to bring them pleasure and they emit semen following the same principle. Therefore, they desire to do those things through which this is brought to pass, and it is rather as though habit becomes nature. On account of this, whoever has not been accustomed to be a passive partner in sexual intercourse before puberty, but starts around puberty, because memory is generated during the activity and pleasure comes along with the memory, on account of their habit they desire to be the passive partner as if they were naturally so constituted-frequency and habit bringing it about just as if they were naturally so inclined. If a man happens to be lustful and self-indulgent each of these comes about more quickly.

As the archetypal rationalist, he ridicules himself by coming up with a mechanical explanation. But he does not make any assumption as to the moral characters of individuals based on sexual proclivities, stating that any disposition whatsoever with some training and willingness to explore oneself (a natural character trait he labels *lustful*). But while he assumes the only role of semen or ejaculation is fecundation hence such biological disposition appear contradictory to natural order, it is never said to go against *natural* proclivities in the sense of causing diseases or damaging bodily function. One can simply be or become that way, almost by chance. And elsewhere he describes pederasty as socially useful and ethically valuable... Not so reactionary !

### Conclusion

While not denying a certain reality, the famous Roman hate for sexual passivity is both misunderstood and exaggerated. Surely enough, Romans were too hasty in associating effeminacy with passivity, it wasn't unconditional either. Individuals of high stature whose virility lied beyond any doubt, could afford being both feminine and masculine. **Truth be told**, effeminate gays do indeed make for the bulk of homosexuals today, so the association isn't (and wasn't) entirely fortuitous or mean. But neither homosexuality nor passive sodomy was ever forbidden, and barely frowned upon. Until Christianity took over.
The confusion between two programs always existed, and all social measures when it comes to mores express an unconscious or conscious will to protect transcendance, however misguided our perception of it may be. In the Quran, adultery is defined by a penetration (in another's man's wife) *longer than the time to boil an egg*. Which is to say, there was no adultery if the man didn't ejaculate. Our interpretation of all of ethnology and history should be revisited with the two instinctive programs of love in mind. We need to rethink our whole literature.

Overall, Greeks (and Romans)' attitude resonates with a divide between *porneia* and *eros*, or we would say in more modern terms, concupiscence/lust compared to **metasexuality** or spiritual love. Temperance is not *not continence*, just like being willing to test and raise one's pain threshold is not torture, as long we don't push it too far. Pleasure is enjoyed and desires are difficult to overcome because they abide by one's nature, while pain and tests of all kinds are not enjoyable, because they go against natural proclivities.

```quote{author="Plutarch", cite="Lycurgus"}
Is it not worth mentioning his self-control in erotic matters if for no other reason than one's amazement at it? One would say that his holding off from those he did not desire was merely the act of an ordinary human. *But he loved Megabates, the son of Spithridates, just as the most intense character would love **the most beautiful boy***.
```
The two Symposium do not actually differ so much: both pitting an <q>Uranian **Eros**</q> versus a <q>lowly</q> desire content to satisfy itself with any **body**, be it a prostitute, an animal or worse... a wife. Among proponents of the latter were some Cynics, since their whole shtick was to shock society *systematically* by whatever means, for ill or good. Hence attacking pederasty as unnatural (bad), while question the taboo of incest (good) and cannibalism (?!). They aligned themselves with animal life... But that of lowly dogs and cows, not apes.

## Degenerate homosexuality

### Anti-sodomy laws {#anti-sodomy-laws}

Lastly when it comes to historical evidences, of course the absence of homophobic punishment should be considered *at minima* evidence of the freedom to have homosexual relationships. But on the other hand, anyone familiar the Middle-East, the Maghreb or medieval history would say remark, that the presence of anti-homophobic laws is *the evidence of nothing*, if not a mildly negative general sentiment of some sort, in some regard, by some parts of the population, which still indulge in sodomy or whatever else anyway. One has to attest to prosecutions and execution of sentences, to prove anything. Today, a law is only worth its application, however casual.

Let us take two exemples, among the most extreme, *verbally that is*: the Sassanid Persians and the Jews, both sharing a properly metaphysical abhorrence of sodomy (either hetero---"incomplete" sodomy---or homo).

In the first case erected as the evil cosmological opposite of swedodah, incest, equally powerful but in the service of Ahriman (their Satan). Chapter 9 of the [Sad Dar](http://www.avesta.org/mp/saddar.html#chapter9) is pretty unambiguous. Unlike any other crime it destroys the soul entirely, so unlike for any other crime anyone bearing witness of the act was to behead or disemboy the culprits immediately, without judgment.

We should learn to use common sense and not accuse people of horrible things without factual evidence. In the Ardā Wīrāz-nāmag, in the <q>crimes against the soul</q> sodomy lies next to <q>A woman lamenting and weeping, having a sharp tongue, quarrelling with her husband, beautifying herself and refusing intercourse</q> as deserving of abominable torture in hell. Now, the explicit purpose of the justice system in Persian society, as it was in Christian society, was to recover *social concorde*, and help those meant to suffer in hell for their sins, by punishing them in this life, henceforth clearing their slate - as well as that of the community, which always share in good deeds and sins.
I believe that taking this literally---the idea that women really were seriously and mercilessly beaten up for speaking their mind or the slightest use of makeup or not being in the mood of having sex---is closer to mental retardation than correct historical method ! Not even Saoudi Freaking Arabia goes this far.

This ridiculously harsh severity even Luther would have objected to was used by Muslim apologists to claim Persia had invented burkas and hijabs and enslaved women before Islam. But thousands of naked and half-naked representations of women were found, in beautiful and sexy settings.

![](/Images/history/sexy-sassanid-picture.webp "<q>Do I live in **modern** Iran to you ?!")

For Jews, you are free to consult Leviticus or talmudic sources but I will not sully that website with Jewish drivel. But we know for a fact that the Leviticus ceased to be applied 2000 years (not we know any more about earlier periods though), since the death of Jesus Christ and the rise of talmudic (or rabinic) judaism. Despite a relative wealth of documents - and the rather cruel, trigger-happy kind of justice they had - there is no account of capital punishment for sodomy [in Jewish history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_views_on_homosexuality#Applicability_of_Biblical_death_penalty).

The impossibility (but necessity) of proving anything, made that threat empty so ultimately the real state of homosexuality in such a culture is left to the level of actual hatred at any current moment, something not controlled nor determined by religious or legal texts. But we know for a fact, that societies have been in touch with sodomy or other such acts on a regular basis despite such apparent regulations.

And in our case, we also have no evidence of such prosecution ever happening in 250 years of Sassanid history[^evidence], something which shouldn't surprise anyone with a slight knowledge of Greek sources, some of which imputed Persians with bringing pederasty to Greece... and later texts do consider a mitigating circumstance sodomy *with a child*. More could be said about the true meaning of these laws, but it suffices to consider them as Excalibur impulses, unconscious reactions to the general degeneracy of any sexuality under cooking conditions, and usually (regardless of the textual violence and threats of eternal damnation) aimed at **correcting** behaviors. On top of that, because all sexuality degenerates, phenomenons like scapegoating take hold.

But first, let us  explained the true degeneracy of the mental disease known as *faggotry*: the dietary and psychoanalytical reason why effeminate men exist, have existed probably since cooking itself but have only now not only taken the spotlight, but truly become the dominant type among homosexuals. There are several factors, in the genesis of the faggot or effeminate personality, to be sorted in two categories:
 - Upbringing
 - Endogenous influences, aka *primary masochism*" and denatured molecules.
  
### Exogenous influences

For the most part, bar from congenital anomalies (which is unlikely in our case as effeminacy has occurred consistently throughout history, signifying un inborn potential for it) abnormal personality developments (relative to genetic data) is always due to wrong upbringing with a wrong education and/or wrong role models.  In cultures denying the spiritual and marked by the reproductive instinctive program on overdrive due to cooking, there the very conceptual framework to understand sacred or true homosexuality properly if at all, is jarringly lacking.

The only conceptual framework to make sense of love is breeding, one male and one female about the same age, to make kids raise them and look after them then make more and repeat. Well,  granted nowadays kids learn about _**some**_ other models increasingly early. But none of them can hope to compete with mainstream ideas as **logical** the equation sex = reproduction remains intact as the perceived natural norm: Some people being allowed to differ if they feel like it, doesn't stop them from being deviants. Still in the early 2000 it was unknown in the wider public (and refused by most primatologists) that bonobos were highly homosexual, let alone the myriad of other species added to the [homo roster].

[homo roster]: https://www.livescience.com/44464-bonobo-homosexuality-natural.html "Being Gay Is Natural: Just Ask Bonobos | Live Science"

If evolution did favor sometimes non-reproductive behaviors, it was either accidental (having no impact on survival) or indirectly favored classic breeding because there is nothing to life but surviving and procreating, **nothing but matter**. In that context only reproductive intercourses makes sense logically.
This is a splendid example of conceptual blindness, low-key dominant for centuries of Christianity. While the Industrial Revolution (for reasons we'll dwell on another time) erected it as an absolute uncontested religion enforced by moralists and physicians, bringing all the Heaven down on Earth and substituting God with Matter.

The result, is the association of socially-induced feeling of sickness or shame with natural homosexual desire, a state of mind which, since energy deal with the **very purpose of existence**... is bound to backfire horribly.

Due to shame, the stronger the homosexual drive (with frustration) the stronger one feels compelled to reject it in all kinds of ways expounded by Freudian psychoanalysis. Some double down on the hetero model by lying to themselves and masquerading as the most rabid homophobes, while others instead seek to ape women in mannerisms through transgenderism or effeminacy to justify their "perversion" in a kind of fake heterosexuality. Wading in self-contradiction, they wish to appease both their own conscience and their natural metasexual needs, a tension yielding more shame and ulterior degeneracy now driven by self-hatred.
Those types of men (barring the unfortunate victims of propaganda) have recently taken the next logical step inaugurated in the West by [Magnus Hirschfeld](germany#hirschfield), transsexualism.

The antifascist component of homosexual identity never perished, even if the extreme left was in the majority, just as it did during the Weimar Republic, which saw the transsexual Hirschfield dominate the media over **the virile Aryan Adolph Brand, author of the world's first homosexual magazine**.

![One_cover_of_the_eigene](/Images/nazi_holocaust_weimar_ww2/der_eigene_cover.webp)

The close association of pedophilia with homosexuality is false (later some statistics showed that **heterosexual pedophilia was by far the majority**), moreover the term pederasty itself has changed its meaning in history and in the 19th century no longer referred to age, but **only to sodomy for both sexes** or sometimes to homosexuality. Consequently, our position, which is essentially open to both sexes, deserves to be called that.
But this amalgam is nevertheless based on a certain reality **of a symbolic order**: for a long time it was less easy to project on the pederast the appearance of the predator, than on the heterosexual pederast (male, of course), unconsciously accused **of making a mistake in the plan and projecting the woman onto the child, thus seeking to live the relationship on a very degrading and, it must be said, traumatic level**.

Feeling the tide turning, many (the majority) of homosexuals chose social conformity, molding themselves into the conventions in the hope of being accepted. Philosophers felt it coming:

```quote{author="Gerard Bach"}
At the beginning of the homosexual movement the thing did not make a problem. But today [1982](#), some homosexuals who are looking for a quick social integration in the society want to ignore the question of pedophilia, which is top embarrassing in their eyes. But if we think about it further, the question of pedophilia - that is to say, the relationship between adults and children - and that of children's sexuality today form the core of sexual liberation in general and homosexual liberation in particular.
```
```quote{author="Guy Hocquenghem"}
We are in the process of fabricating a type of criminal, and a criminal who is so horrible to conceive that his crime at the limit is self-explanatory [...](#) No one even cares any more whether there was a victim, because if there is a victim, there is always a victim. The crime feeds totally on itself by the manhunt, [...](#) and it ends up in this form of call to the lynch mob once more that present today certain articles of the press.
```

While a forceful reeducation to virility and the true essence of male intimacy can save a good number of effeminates, making true men out of them, we absolutely share the opinion that transsexuals have crossed the line of no-return and the only possible liberation for their soul (and mutilated body) from this state of perpetual suffering is a merciful death. In the end though, they are victims of a system denying the very meaning of existence for which they craved enough to forfeit their humanity. **A poor education and/or subpar intelligence conjugated with industrial food, and the crazy high mental feedback level did the rest.**

This was for the exogenous, social influence, the socially-induced or *secondary guilt*. Freud on the other hand speculated the existence of an inborn or primary guiltiness, innately bound to sexuality and related to a <q>death drive</q>, as a natural counter-weight to Eros, the pleasure principle.

### Endogenous masochism {#primary}

Obviously analysts and moralists rushed to abuse this concept, to rationalize their sadomasochistic practices for repression and self-inflicted suffering as natural... I whip myself so I am. No joke, Freud's orthodox successors went that far down the rabbit hole.

Howbeit, formulated as he did the notion of **primary masochism** doesn't have to imply a (phylo)genetic or hereditary etiology,though he did favor such an explanation... Or rather, lest for ditching it completely We do not believe neither him nor anyone of the time could have made sense of this intuition in any other way. They needed the experience of **raw food**.

Primary means <q>not learned through interaction with other people</q> but there is another source of behavioral denaturation: cooked food.

Cooking-induced feedbacks alter brain functioning and heighten three essential cognitive tendencies up to pathological proportions, as described by Mr Burger: psychosis, schizoid dissociation and paranoia (or egotism). We shall defer to his books for more details, but we'll stick with paranoia for a bit, for it lies at the core of the whole failure of modern sexuality, and its incapacity to reach its natural transcendent purpose, even in seemingly **_kosher_** relationships such homosexual or Greek-style pedophiliac ones.

Paranoia, as he defined, is the innate tendency to be convinced of something regardless of evidence or logical inference. Or maybe, the ability to continue in a given direction in absence of immediate verification or gratification, until the task's fulfillment. In itself, there is nothing wrong with this, hence I used the word <q>ability</q>: all animals are capable to some degree of postponing satisfaction while holding on to a behavior. Going further, no situation in life is ever totally, absolutely certain: not even the sun rising again tomorrow. We create absolutes out of habit and convenience, but such worldviews really are products of repeated experience.

However, what we mundanely label as paranoia (or ego) is the certitude of being right despite conspicuous evidence of the contrary, and the incapacity or stern refusal to even consider alternative points of view. And by evidence, I mean failing at the stock exchange five times in a row yet still persisting and losing thousands in a laughably terrible move while lashing out at all in an attempt to dissuade him and blaming others for one's own mistake... Or marrying two times only slightly smarter (but evil) depraved foreign women for their vaginas, and loosing not thousands but **hundreds** of thousands, falling for the very same obvious (well, not to him !) traps. Add both feats to the same individual and you get the spitting image of low-IQ paranoia not even raw food could cure.

As cartoonish (though real) this example may be, paranoia though isn't limited to clinical morons, it takes so varied cultured or widespread shapes we don't notice it until it's gone, in either cultural institutions or one's own personality.

Feedback coupled with the endogenous over-excitation of cooking also produces, results in a strong tendency to repeat and latch on any source of strong physical pleasure of a rather coarse kind. This focalisation and fixation paranoid on physical sensations itself, is the number one cause of the metapsychic failure of the quasi-totality of relationships regardless of sexual orientation.

In these conditions maintaining the proper inner attitude conducive for the emergence of paranormal abilities of any kind, is impossible with cooking for 99% of people in Ancient Greece... and 99.99% today.

Even with the best spiritual and meditative efforts, this endogenous excitation of molecular origin disrupts the most sensitive cognitive processes dealing with energy, disrupting the very calm and receptivity necessary. Normative heterosexuality is much worse in every way conceivable, no question asked, but parapsychic achievements of the kind we observe, have been impossible but for the smallest fraction of the population since time immemorial.

Though Greeks had respect and a modicum of understanding for sacred love, how many Socrates and Plato among them ? Even Aristotle, the latter's most brilliant disciple (arguably, lover), grasped **none of it whatsoever**.

And to put things in context we've just discussed highly evolved subtle people for which the baseness or sheer lack of aesthetics of half the current homo population (lesbians fare better) would appear thoroughly incomprehensible, and utterly disgusting. What hope then, does the common drug-filled or condom-worshiping gay have to get telepathy ?

Lastly, cooking also specifically physiologically amps up breeding impulses causing what we call a transpulsional induction entailing the confusion of objects of one instinctive program for the closely related pattern in the other program... People just can't help but play out the reproductive instinctive pattern in their head and life and **_feel_** jealousy, possessivity and nesting (investing on material possessions, a nice house etc) as innate.

These low quality homos while much nicer, less frustrated than heteros and not losing all their energy in the Wound in the Force that are vaginas, deep down are actually heterosexuals in disguise, treating butts like vaginas. Some very real energy is invested in the wrong channels, desecrating the most revered instrument of divine knowledge with a vile quest for personal enjoyment (or equally lowly very feminine sentimentalism).

For fake homos, no heaven or life after death, no more than more normies. And no wonder, those types are the ones begging for tolerance and crying. They are equal to normal couples.... Because they are. Or worse.

And top it all... such heavy misdirection of instincts, isn't missed out, for it is never a gratuitous choice to miss the most important part of life. Angry as all hell, the subconscious generates endogenous feelings of guilt and inadequacy (which we can not decode conceptually), soon turning into inner distress through compulsion as they are not heeded as should be the case in nature, finally warping personality under ever more unbearable weights of unexpressed self-loathing negativity. This represents Freud's not-so-primary **primary masochism**.
And this closes our exposé of the ontology of effeminate homosexuality, or all uninspired homosexualities for the matter.

### The Führerprinzip

As we wander streets on any day, we see weak, spineless men controlled by their wives, exuding no virility or sense of confidence. As much as we can blame Jewish and feminist efforts to undermine our culture, we wouldn't have been sensitive to their propaganda in the first place if men had not been not been **weak, spineless children first**. Hedonism, degeneracy and weakness of character - as demonstrated by the chore of videos of women raped or people beaten up in the subway by subhumans with no one bating an eye - all stem from the absence of moral character, that our model of education totally neglects. But going about this education would require a complete overhaul of sexuality, in particular with children. *Greek pederasty* (the alliance of tough love and disinhibited sexuality in its vertical component) creates the strongest children, free from doubt and fixations, able to face the hardships of life and the tasks demanded of them by society (for good or bad) We need to rethink the way we educate children, how love, pedagogy, authority and discipline relate to each other.

Europeans need the character to trust entirely those with the most inspiration in hope to approach their divinity. To ascend to their level to some degree. By first obeying his instructions, then emulating them earnestly, in order to **truly making ours his qualities** and thought process by **uniting to him on an energetic level**. This following of the strongest derives from our survival instinct, except that inspiration advantageously replaced physical strength.

<q>Lead and be led</q> or **Führer Prinzip**, is the indivision of willingly obeying those we recognize as superior, and of assuming full responsibility in carrying out their will in the fullest of our capacity[^prussia]. All for one, and one for all, with prussian characteristics[^prussian]. The key to foster that kind of personality, is hierarchical erotic relationships, *also known as pederasty*. It should come as no surprise thus, that teaching is conceptually inseparable from natural love, as energy and truth are two sides of the same coin. All successful cultures figured this out.
	
This is how we can fill the spiritual gap between boys and girls - hence between women and men - at last ending the psychological notion of gender and the resulting cultural divide. This gap despite having definite roots in biology, is actually an **accident of cooking** (and the resulting culture) twisting what the psychology of both men and women should look like. We also affirm that mens' penis has a unique and instinctive role in energy circulation across genders and age **through sodomy** due to its fundamental indifference to reproductive status. The consequences on the organization of society are potentially large.

We affirm that due to being totally *unaffected by reproductional status*, through **sodomy** men' penis has a unique and instinctive role in energy circulation across genders and age. The consequences on the organization of society are large.

```quote{cite="[Agoge: The Rigorous Education and Training System of Spartans - Historyplex](https://historyplex.com/agoge-education-training-system-of-spartans)"}
in Sparta, both boys and girls were imparted education, albeit in different manners. Not only was the agoge deemed extremely necessary, but the successful completion of the training regime was a prerequisite in order to receive Spartan citizenship. The objective behind the intensive education and training regime was to produce strong, brave Spartans who would protect the city come what may.
These children were taught never to fear anything, and were often ignored when they cried. The strict parental approach of the Spartans was renowned far and wide, and **Spartan women were often asked to become caretakers or nannies of children of the elite outside Sparta**.
```

It has to be explained why those kids by and large (or ever) wouldn't just fall into despondency, depression, abandonism. Nothing original in saying kids need both a pole of love and a pole of discipline/authority, though bad mouthing **any** fatherly role trends a lot today which isn't a surprise considering real men almost ceased to exist in this society. But how exactly is that supposed to work, how is balance realized ? Can unlimited strictness compensate for unlimited indulgence, unconditional indulgence ? *No, this would be the perfect recipe for schizophrenia, that can be induced in dogs* which just lose it when facing highly contradictory attitudes mixing rewards and punishments without rhyme or reason.

Parents (and to a lesser degree educators, reciprocal friends and lovers) should ask everything, infinite efforts from their offspring, squeeze out the least success in achieving their potential. And at the same time provide infinite love and acknowledgment. **The key to this seeming paradox**, is to understand **what love even means**.

In our Western liberal society love is more often than not confused with self-indulgence or between lovers' reciprocal indulgence of a nearly-contractual character which extends to the sexual sphere: I do you if you do me, that kind of thing. It became an agreement for each party to allow each to stroke their egos continuously, feeding their vanity or sense of (undue) self-importance.
Remove the sacred part of love, and there's only partial gratifications or sentimental attachments left, but without energy or the prospect of it, it feels kinda hard to ask any personal effort of anyone without such binding contracts, without appealing to each partner's egoism.

In absence of true love and energy, parenting has become little more than narcissistic projections hiding a sadistic undertone.
{.aside .important #child-king}

**Genuine** parenting on the opposite (or genuine love) was all about wishing the best for the kid, helping him to fulfill his transcendent destiny above any other concern while doing anything in one's power to accomplish that goal, even if that meant killing one's child with oneself if he dared to sully the family's honor, like Japanese samurais' mothers were said to.

We should understand such acts (_more a performative fantasy than common facts_) as benevolent, as without honor one is nothing and cannot not live up to one's potential so being put out of one's misery is not cruelty but mercy.

The resilience of a child and his capacity to endure like a man instead of caving in or prostrating *like a Swedish cuck*, is a function of his **energy level** and **trust in his parents' good intentions, which comes to down to the certain prospect of energy with them**.

Hence I don't find it especially jarring that Japanese children can notoriously cope with an objectively insane training regimen to prepare them for universities.
Unhealthy as it may be (arguably), the fact they do manage those training without breaking or not nearly as much as we would, is a testament to the customary intensity of parental love in Asia. As a proof, Japanese until twenty to thirty years or so, used to bathe with their opposite sex parent, usually until 15, or limitlessly. Mixed bathing in onsen was normal until feminists and Western influence **exorcised** it out. And anyone thinking nothing happened must be an incurable fool.[^evidences] That explains why Japanese children until recently appeared superior, and explains the impressive reconstruction efforts after the war.

**Incestuous orgasm-fueled superpowers**.

![scholarship](/Images/manga_comics/scholarship_5.webp "The next logical  step")

Relationships with teachers have always been customary until their defeat, with admiring instances of dedication from teachers, housing and financing students for free at a time where universities were all private and one heck of an investment for families (this hasn't changed terribly...).

We have to think in economic terms: energy is a resource, which like physical energy, can be acquired, transformed into useful work, or lost entirely in heat, its most entropic or degenerative form. A wholly entropic system can not be put to work anymore, it creates friction and things start breaking down real quick.. When we perform automatic tasks requiring no mental efforts, but merely follow a kind of algorithmic pattern however complex, then we don't really use our higher abilities, with little to no human intuition at play, the brain just gets to run its usual well-trained and well oiled course. In those situations we act like computers and do not feel much if any effort, merely the physical tension of investing attention, and even this is proportional how much we're used to the task.

But things are different whenever we need to **learn**, change our ways, develop totally new skill sets out of sheer grit or merely function beyond our ordinary, physical capacities. Running counter already established lines of functioning or years of mental reference to specific beliefs isn't free.

To break free from conditioning or adopt new ones, is costly and spend energy, transforming it with more or less efficiency giving off more or less steam or **mental friction** in the process.
{.important}

Adults - average americans - can function in their job on sometimes ludicrously low love energy levels  same for scholars: exceedingly intellectual and smart creatures but wasting their life in inane pursuits writing useless papers, which hardly anyone will read, nor be impacted by. Without inspiration we make the wrong choices, as Einstein said[^Einstein]. 

```quote{author="Plutarch", cite="[Life of Lykourgos](https://www.greek-love.com/antiquity/pederasty-in-ancient-sparta)" .aside}
When the boys reached this age [12](#), they were favored with the society of lovers from among the reputable young men.

```

Children on the other hand, need to learn even the most elementary laws, in the wild (apes) their very survival depends on it hence the reason for our extended childhood. Children thus especially crave for love to fuel their growth.

Yet, though *correct* intellectual maturation depends on energy-information **it pales in comparison to metapsychical needs**: building the soul and its psychic abilities requires a tremendous amount. As a result Spartan kids had no issue expressing themselves fully, morally, physically, intellectually, and adults' demands were merely commensurate with their capabilities. Textual evidence abound regarding the free access to love to all ages and the generalization of sodomy including for young girls[^young_girls]. 
That mindset must be understood as the *refusal of weakness*, taking the form of a masculinization of **both** sex.
```quote{cite="Excess and Ergi: Exploring the Sexual Valences of Supernatural Episodes in the Íslendingasǫgur" author="Matthiew Roby"}
Clover envisages an Icelandic conception of gender and sexual norms that **lauded masculine dominance and aggression regardless of the individual’s biological sex**. She outlines a “one-sex” model, in which power and sovereignty – commonly but not exclusively associated with males – were ubiquitous aspirations, while powerlessness – commonly but not exclusively associated with females – was denigrated as shameful.

Hence, Clover deconstructs the notion of a rigid gender binary, suggesting that men and women compete on the same socio-sexual scale. 
{.important}
```

Now let's go back to the agoge, to know what it consisted in:
> [Between 7 and 12](#) at the communal barracks where the groups of children were housed, the boys were imparted education which ranged from academics and sports to training in hunting and warfare. The male students were treated like future soldiers, and their education was mainly military-oriented.
Children were taught how to endure hardship, pain, fatigue, hunger, as well as the bitter cold. Their athletic activities included gymnastics and different ancient sports, which they had to undertake barefoot. They were also given severely rationed food daily, so as to accustom them to hunger and thirst. Obviously this was never pushed so far as to stunt their growth.

> The main intention of the agoge regime was to **discipline the students at a young age**. They were taught how to read and write, war poems, history, singing, dancing, as well as the works of Homer. Sources support the notion that intellectual acumen is even more a Spartan defining characteristic than their martial prowess.

As must be apparent now, while swimming in sexual care up to the neck, young people were treated like adults, so the adult in them could awaken. We have less information on girls, beyond the fact their respective love lives were nigh identical: no weak sex, no infantilization of women.

![pedo_love_voyage](/Images/meta/photo_voyage_pedo.webp "Commercial add\

{.no_auto}

On a psychological level, we think children should come to experience the widest and most intense range of emotions and inner experiences possible, sadness, rage, pity, love, desire, so that nothing coming their way later could disturb their sense of balance, their stability.

### True gender roles.

How do men and women differ, and why ?
Truth be told, when we consider an overview of all pre-industrial societies as a whole, we realize genders don't matter much. Yes, women tend to revolve around the relational (taking care of others, community building) and men around making stuff (the material) and exploration.
Nevertheless specifics are so variable divergent depending on the specific culture, that dwelling on this or building an ontology or a cosmology around yin and yang, Mars and Venus or whatnot is utterly pointless, and anyone older than 20 with eyes to see, should have met enough diverging characters in both sexes to be convinced of the same.

The greatest divide between sexes seems to have been the neolithic revolution, with the advent of agriculture and complexification (and ossification) of society. Hunter-gatherer societies appear quite egalitarians, everyone contributing a little to the survival of the group. There's been debate for years about how many hours a day working for survival (collecting food, processing it) takes them, at least those still surviving up to now.
In Europe pre-industrial societies, before the miracle of science and free market, did not actually conform to fantasies of back-breaking toil at the hands of evil lords and nobles[^preindustrial].
Sexual division of labor has never been a practical need, and in pre-human times we only had to climb the damn tree to eat, break open a beehive and munch some leaves. People's lives would naturally gravitate around what they like. African hunter-gatherers like Bushman or the !Kong on the other hand not only settled for the most part in unnatural (for apes) environments lacking most of what we need, but lack the brain to improve their daily life either by moving to an **actually decent place**, or learning to cultivate it like White people do.

![d](/Images/memes/meme_african_retardation.webp "Niggers gonna nig.")
{.aside}

In most traditional societies with vastly inefficient production methods and habits, Whites introducing any improvement that could cut work time or raise yield only ever faced the same almost automatic response: <q>why ? We've always done it like this</q>.
When asked to sell everything she had at once at an advantageous price for her, they would refuse, arguing <q>I would have nothing to do the rest of the day</q>. With that mentality, nothing is possible, not even in a million years...
{.aside}

Beside, tools as means of force multiplication makes the very real physical strength gap between sexes irrelevant (regards to survival in the wild), while groups ensure the impossibility of domination through brute force alone, chimpanzee females easily ganging up then dismembering any male at 4 vs 1 or less.

The most glaring gap we observe lies in intelligence. As IQ tests show women as more centered on the mean, lacking much of the genius and high-achieving spectrum responsible for the advancement of society. Women maintain and relish in the status quo, men strive for what they perceive as progress: revolutionary groups, for ill or bad, were all male-dominated. Most women lack the ingenuity, curiosity and rationality to "*take the next step*" in any important reasoning[^Sturgeon].

Curiosity or the lack thereof is a problem, but the worst one is the irrationality: **As a general rule, how many women are capable of putting aside emotions when considering a sensitive issue, whatever that is ?** Granted, nowadays few men can either, but I have yet to see even one woman managing when it comes to sexuality, children or what comes in and out of their own wombs. This is why women voting was a terrible idea.

But why have we got to that point and is it curable ?
We need to **understand what it means on a deeper level**.
Women lack divine inspiration, they lie on the base, material level, of sensation or sentiment. The call of destiny and total dedication to a spiritual ideal has been masculine all along history, with some exceptions of course.

There is little differentiation based on sex below puberty, and virgin girls keep longer an air of purity to them, as a fortiori do lesbians. On the other hand, mature girls most will simply react to novelty defensively because evolution made them wary of anything troubling the stability and safety of the nest, to raise the offspring.

All of this mirrors the divide between the reproductive instinctive program and metapsychic instinctive program and for obvious reasons females of all species (save for hyenas perhaps...) are easy to sway to a reproductive mindset, thus by nature leaning toward social *conservatism and conformism*, as keenly noted by many philosophers[^jung_weiniger] is truer now than ever. But unlike earlier conservatives we believe in women' bright future in a transfigured world, without cooking, now aligned with their deeper, lesbian and pederastic self.

In our society, as Freud put it, their lack of curiosity has to do with their lack of sexuality early on, as children, for which reaching the clitoris is notably harder without being introduced by someone else, namely a parent or older sibling. Even in a context of repression, a boy's sexual needs are always closer to his mind and his sex to his sight.
As a result he is much more likely to touch himself and not a single boy doesn't, be it in his dreams: on the other hand girls can easily spend their whole childhood, nay, life, without knowing a damn thing about her clitoris and so never orgasm a single time. Eternal sexual dissatisfaction makes them empty shells, superficial creatures living only on the level of sensation, yet without knowing the exhilarating feeling of being alive with adrenaline and electricity rushing through your veins which is synonymous with energy.
Girls who know how to satisfy themselves are better off, more lively, not featuring the meekness we usually ascribe to their sex.

**On the other hand**, modern women show how engaging in such activities and the knowledge of orgasm did not help women much: frustration hasn't diminished. Instead it transmuted from a crude organic level to a much more important metapsychic dissatisfaction, the lack of **energetic** orgasms. Modern women's access to pleasure fuelled an unlimited sense of entitlement: anything that can fuel their vanity will do so. So we see it isn't an issue of pleasure, so much as of psychic structuring.

All throughout history, people have noticed the female stunted, lower soul, lesser ability to think themselves to the Truth. Others assimilated this to a stronger animal nature compared to men, and that is entirely true, but modern society showed that cultural sexual repression of men on women isn't to blame as much as leftist thought, as today women can access pleasure as much as men (whether they actually do is not the absent patriarchy's fault !).
{#female_breeding_weakness}

So men have more often than not been the leaders, chieftains, kings and emperors, with women catering for local communities, their own, maintaining the status quo whatever it is, fair or unfair, logic or not. Doesn't this somewhat lack in grandeur ?
I believe this lack of spark, of **will to achieve**, to be a direct expression of cooking and its dissimilar, very asymmetric: amplifying base animal instincts makes women meeker, just like the hen or cow submit to the cock or bull respectively. Within our genes and brain structures a whole set of character traits is ever present, stemming from ancient, outdated evolutionary pressures from millions to tens of millions of years ago, already present in the simplest animals to be honest - save for rare outliers like hyenas with aggressive girls boasting several times males' testosterone rates.

This set of traits and tendencies form the core of lesser species whose entire lives around the need for reproduction (which is the one purpose of all lower lifeforms at least on the species' level), is what we call the **breeding instinctive program**. What happens to women as this ancient evolutionary background is artificially stimulated by cooking, is a shift in life interests toward baser concerns seemingly all related to reproductive needs:
 - Nesting: having a big, comfortable house (even when children are far, far ahead in the planning or unthinkable with current partners), cleaning the house, cooking (feeding the fledgeling !).
 - Gossiping
 - Keeping the men busy or downright manipulating them with sex in hope they continue providing resources and caring for kids, and ensuring said men don't see other females as it would dilute their attention. 

Men' animal instincts are simpler, cruder, but also saved them from perdition: we males want to fuck, regardless of the situation. We at least **do it**, sometimes with little regards as to where. While our attention shifts from anality and polymorphisms to coitus, which is a terrible consequence, reaching some modicum of satisfaction is still easier, because both breeding and metasexual instincts push us toward stacking the body count, so to speak.

And both use the penis whereas the same shift toward coitus for women has had a very different consequence: the absolute center (and only source, anatomically) of pleasure for girls is their clitoris, which simply has no role whatsoever in a breeding situation. This leads girls in cooking to automatically disregard their clitoris even as they know it's there.
In general the more uninspired a woman is, the more her focus will shift from her obvious true needs (cumming) to manipulative behaviors, either through scheming (hence the endless gossiping) or submission to the male. Both attitudes conducive to keeping the male(s) to herself and her own material, social or emotional situation afloat. Even though in no way this appears to give her satisfaction or pleasure. Cooked females simply identify to their reproductive, forsaking entirely their eventual access to pleasure and so an eventual higher spiritual or cognitive development.

The patriarchy's prejudices against girls while indeed justified for the reasons explained above, when going too far - out of **hatred** - unfortunately **added** to female inferiority, cementing it: by relegating females sometimes by laws (Muslim and Jewish societies) into the exclusive breeding role they seem to focus on on their own accord, men have ensured women wouldn't improve on their tendencies. This is a classic case of our true nature being fallen and needing culture to bring itself to the fore. 

That's why we need to enforce lesbianism and generate an upward movement subjecting women to the same hardships men have always known, in order to develop similar qualities. To **man up** and stop whining like little bitches.

![lesbian_teacher](/Images/manga_comics/itou_lesbian.webp "Sexuality and learning are one")

On the opposite, the insane privileges and unfairly easy treatment bestowed on women compared to men in this disgusting feminist society in sheer virtue of their genitalia (best instance being the military and dumbing down of standards to accommodate weak women) **infantilized** the former. In the end we recuse both retarded traditional roles (<q>Kinder, Küche, Kirche</q>) and modern feminism, for they end up doing the exact same thing, robbing women of the opportunity and need to grow collectively and as individuals.

It is crucial for adequate structuring to develop before puberty otherwise all the libido, aspirations and expectations pertaining to the spiritual and the metapsychic program are transferred on to the reproductive program, because that one starts automatically at puberty.

Problem is, its potency is multiplied tenfold by cooking, and at the same time that penetrative impulses aren't channeled into **active** sodomy anymore, breeding fantasies take over completely. Spiritual degradation simply follows automatically too a *rich* diet, meat chiefly, as shown by ever earlier menstruation: it is the same physiological phenomena.

To compensate for this it is vital 95% of the time for girls to discover pleasure in a energetic context before puberty, more so than for boys as the biological imperative to breed is so much stronger, and in general the feminine will-power too weak to undergo such a grueling process as changing one's whole worldview and psychosexual sensibility, that truth be told past 15 nothing much can expected from a woman beyond the level she already arrived at due to circumstances. The will - or capacity - for self-betterment, is very much children' or men' characteristics. *Currently*.

Now that we laid out women' defects and found out they might be missing the most. Spartans exposed for all to see, the result of generalizing pederasty to all age and all sex:
Women became as headstrong and resilient as their male equivalent, intelligent and duty-bound, while ignoring flaws such as possessivity, idle gossip and backhanded badmouthing.

United under a strong patriarchal leadership, they obtained total freedom and total responsibility, they obtained **true virility which has nothing to do with superficial development or impressive physics**:
{#girl_sodomy}

Virility is about standing your ground no matter what, giving your best, honoring the gods and inspiring your peers, gaining immortality by living up to one's true possibilities. True masculinity and true femininity only differ superficially, men being more straight forward, convincing through diamond-like shining logic and intimating respect authority through their powerful physique while women appease with graceful gentle words, fluid diplomacy and the pure crystal-clear innocent beauty of prepubescent girls, whose traits are maintained with instincto.

In the end, a complete individual changes its tune depending on the situation, and [embodies everything at once, regardless of gender](https://www.youtube.com/embed/IzINu0wezWU?clip=UgkxB3I6W_y5OgvQ50TqA1ndSPmkeQtBDxqH&amp;clipt=EJ6CAhi7hQU).

Bluntly said, for children' sake a group based on national-naturalist principles should either *put women in their place* in a truly reactionary fashion, claiming paternal ownership of children, or we shall allow independent lesbians à la Ripley (from Alien) in command roles, *the first and foremost being motherhood*. There is no value in someone staunchly persuaded that her mission in life is to lay eggs, unwinding several tens of millions of years of evolution.

![Ripley alien kid](/Images/spirituality/mythology/modern/alien_ripley_weapon_kid.webp "Long live *tomboy nationalism*")

The touch of inspired men in their early years (along with [that of older women, still genetically the most powerful impulse in females](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yhbeh.2019.104581)) provided girls with the formative energy-information quintessential in shaping their character. Thus united, both sexes we could stand strong **in a brighter universally proudly militarist future**.

Women shaped by such an education, as Sparta proved, could totally provide for an adequate father role (a so-called *pole of discipline*) without losing their feminine grace, while modern fathers are either careless tyrants or spineless wimps, in both cases metasexually impotent and frustrated.

*To burn with the wish to bury yourself in one's mother, is not wrong*, but it should have been done a long time ago, and done thoroughly. Then a correct relationship with the rest of womanhood could have been built, without the delusion of finding love and transcendence with any adult female outside one's relatives. But which could be lived (emphasis on **<q>could</q>**) within the family, was never meant to work with normal aged females.

But when people refuse to see the light and better themselves, because this is the truth there is a way to change them **without their consent**.

### Rape therapy

Rape has been seen very differently through history. Most cultures have disapproved of it, nearly all in fact, to no one's surprise: only someone desperate would resort to force to get sexual attention. Everyone would be appalled by the pain, blood and injuries, that much is obvious, and the criminal would be swiftly punished, if found, most often by the family of the victim, assuming she has one. In the past, justice concerned more the honor of the clan, of the wronged husband and the risk of unknowingly birthing and nurturing the rapist' child, at times where knowledge of biology paled compared to ours.

However our current feminist culture is of the rare on record, seeing in forced copulations something as diabolical as do we do today, the killing of the soul, leaving a taint even [for generations to come](https://www.psycom.net/trauma/epigenetics-trauma) ! Many cultures, matriarchal and patriarchal, considered the act pathetic or disgraceful but didn't care much either way, or deemed the female victim partly to blame. Matrioski relate about Trobriandese, how a woman was raped and after the fact commented <q>it wasn't so bad</q>.
Simply put, when people aren't too repressed and sex is available, no one but morons would rape. But no one **at all** would display sadism, and no woman would even resist to the point of fighting for her life, because her life or well-being would not never be in danger. So already compulsive impulses had no occasion to escalate. And finally, in decent cultures, virginity has always been an embarrassing stain to get rid of, a proof no one wanted to love you, not even a relative.

Rape exists in nature as a valid breeding strategy, but in humans only happens under cooked conditions when low self-control meets pent-up sexual and/or energetic frustration (and resentment, toward one woman or all of them) **that become compulsive**. Forceful demonstrations, up to and including rapes, can be understood as desperate calls to help, turning sour. In a situation where acting out is a psychological necessity, the guilt and fear of punishment the more things risk getting out of hand, with victims dying as a consequence. Because sex is not just about pleasure... that much can be obtained with a hand or two.
Behind, we find the need for **energy**, the food of the soul. **The most important food in existence**. That explains why its lack can make people mad, crazy with resentment against society and those they deem should provide him with said sustenance... women or children. As such, sexual distress is society's disease most of the time, and we should try to look with compassion to sexual offenders who carry its symptoms, *when no serious hurt has been done seriously*[^now_rape]. In those cases social shaming is often judged sufficient[^punishment].
On the contrary cultures where accepting sex easily out of compassion or pity is no big deal, lead to much more manageable sexual excess when they **do** happening.

We National-Naturalists, unironically believe in rape, but a very different kind indeed.
{.important}

What if coercion could be used as a teaching instrument, when people too far gone refuse to hear anything and change their optics about non-normative relationships ?

*Pain* is not compatible with a functional metasexuality, this invariably causes an autonomic clamping of muscles, of the butt, instead of the necessary relaxing, especially indispensable when it comes to penetration of any sort. This invariably turns rape into pain, and we want to avoid that absolutely. But coercion in and of itself, is not incompatible.

What if a regular adult heterosexual man, without any energy, were to be strapped to a bed, gently explained the situation, while being mounted by a ten years-old **girl** until frothing orgasm ? The process would then repeat over the days as often as necessary. Because energy and physical reactions are not, and **can not** be under conscious control, due to the accumulating sense of guilt and patient explanations, orgasms in such conditions would quickly achieve to convert the person under treatment to the truth.

Regular straight people are precisely those who have not been able to connect this dimension at all in childhood or adolescence. It is likely that enough _humiliation_ we can _break down certain internal barriers_.
The same basic principle behind torture and brainwashing, with _psychological humiliation and pleasure_ instead of pain and distress dismantling not the Ego, in order to realize the truth by confronting the victim with the reality of his or her situation and unconscious longing.
Energy is to some degree a physical phenomena, touching the deepest part of the self, transcending the normal mind. As such, accompanied with clear propaganda, the rape therapy as defined above would function much better than torture, actually helping the part of the Unconscious of the victim yearning for true sexual release.

Any pain or threat of violence would, on the contrary, provide too easy an escape route for the mind, giving it culprits to incriminate, beside most likely killing off sexual reactions in both men and women.

The past is full of stories of soldiers forcing cruelly forcing family members to have sex with one another to humiliate them, most of these stories being false, as most always degenerate soldiers capable of that, such Mongols or Buryati in the Russian or Soviet army, *would invariably do the raping themselves*. In a different register but seeking the same result, Tantric exercises in the Tibet of yore included many practices with the express intent of breaking through cultural conditioning and moral constructs limiting oneself. Unfortunately tantrism never sought to [relished in breeding fixations](spirituality#tantric_probleml) (seeking nubile girls to penetrate) while we intend to break people from them, by any means congruent with *natural and human laws*.

In the case of a male victim, the "aggressor" being penetrated obviously eases the process, but a little girl could be changed to an older **daughter**, for convenience, and depending on what we aim to teach. if we need to inculcate homosexuality. Teaching **passive** penetration would be challenging in two ways. One needs to avoid pain, which sodomy does cause very easily with constraint if one is not extremely patient, especially under cooking. A lot of patience, and force-feeding of raw food, could work, but we must also maintain in the person to be reeducated **the illusion of culpability**, so as to turn it against her.
With vaginal penetration (by a little boy or brother) lubrification is usually too easy already, so there is much less of a problem. Concretely the choice of practice to impose would depend on the **pleasure** and the **shame** given. Reaching pleasure proves unconscious consent, while penetrations have the advantages of matching most unconscious representations of "real sex", and being easier to impose (with erections and lubrication both escaping conscious control).

### National-socialism and homosexuality

While at face value National-Socialists hated homosexuals and pedophilia with passion and prosecuted them all, in reality persecution was much more *selective* than both modern and contemporary statements would have you believe, and it appears that *perversion* was tolerated, although *hidden from public scrutiny*.

We should keep in mind that there has never been any complete world-view or set of beliefs characterizing all of Hitler's followers or adherents to the NSDAP. Hitler's own views were always flexible, prioritizing political success and the good of the country over an adherence to whatever particular dogma. And what the majority thought at one point (or the Führer himself for the matter) doesn't define the *movement* neither, the core ideas, which are perfectly compatible preferring butts over cunts, a so-called <q>deviancy</q>[^p].

Germany's fall into reactionarism was both unfortunate and actually not nearly as terrible for virile pederasts and homosexuals and far more open-minded *in practice* than the current antifascist revision of history would have us believe. Unsurprisingly, propaganda doesn't always match facts.

![](/Images/meta/RichardWagner.webp "die Lehre von der Regenerierung")

Nurtured by Wagner's doctrine of Regeneration (favorable to sexual freedom at a time where no chemicals, contraceptives or ill-advised science could sully it), widespread naturism and a healthy admiration for living naturally led to Germans developing an equally healthy love for themselves despite an enduring Christian legacy. It also contributed to the rise of a racism devoid of hate - save for its self-proclaimed enemies, the Jewish nation.

Germans were famous for their interest in other cultures and races and for pioneering ethnography. During  the Wilhelmine Empire of Mittelafrika, German colonizers had the love and respect of the locals, who acknowledged them as benevolent rulers... a feat neither French nor Belgians could boast of. On a perhaps more disturbing note, even under Hitler pages of Der Adler or similar widely spread magazines could contain openly erotic appreciations and photographs of Ethiopian women.

Germany knew then not the narrow-minded chauvinism belched by subhumans by subhuman hooligans, soccer stadiums brim with at all major matches and often ending up in violent affrays with their kindreds supporting the adverse team, usually adverse nationality as well.

But one kind is made of love of ourselves and our kinmen, understanding of the world and other people, open-mindedness and a will to ascend to greater heights as a community, not against others but for ourselves. To become the best we can be.
On the contrary is another kind of nationalism, fundamentally different, based on resentment, hatred of others, chauvinism, ignorance and the unearned and false conviction to already best anyone in everything, if not be straight-up the *chosen people*, grand delusions compensating for a actual (and truthful) sense of inferiority on an [energetic level, due to sexual repression](incest#psyche). Polish, Turkish or Spanish nationalism come to mind, although ultimately it reflects the inner quality of a people so either type can be found anywhere to various degrees.

![reject](/Images/memes/reject-modernity-embrace-tradition-pederasty.webp)

![](/Images/memes/jew_against_homo_greek.webp "Nazis' predicaments in a nutshell") 

Germans' acts spoke for themselves. The incredible economic success, righteously fighting the good fights without breaking a sweat, outclassing all other powers with honor while suffering the unspeakable conducts of the British, Soviet and American camp, monsters in human forms: all that testify of the not high but *stellar* degree of inspiration. At home, the humanity of the Nazi Germany in regards to prisoners, defeated enemies and even Jews in camps (if Allies had not bombed the country and its infrastructure to oblivion) also testifies of the truly astounding level of humanity of these people. And we saw that **the so-called persecution of homosexuals was 80% a myth**.

Those facts alone indicate that overall Germans were not [a gaggle of frustrates](incest#psyche), nor were especially skimmish about sexuality either. This myth of Nazi sexual retardation is no longer accepted by historians, who see now the time as marked by both sexual repression **and** sexual liberation. I would dare say: an attempt at sexual **_correction_**.

The *unabated popularity of naturism* despite a fierce opposition by Christians (championed by Goering), *illustrates this cultural fight and victory with remarkable clarity*:
```quote{cite="[Prussian Minister President and Interior Minister Hermann Goering, 3 March 1933](https://cljcloyd.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/for-a-genuine-and-noble-nakedness.pdf)"}
One of the greatest dangers for German culture and morality is the so-called <q>naked culture movement</q>. Whilst it is to be welcomed in the interest of public health that ever greater numbers of our population, particularly in the cities, are striving to apply the healing power of the sun, fresh air and water to their bodies, the naked culture movement must be rejected as a cultural aberration. The naked culture movement deadens the woman’s natural sense of shame, removes men’s respect for women, and thereby destroys the conditions for any genuine culture. Therefore I expect from all police authorities that—in support of the spiritual powers developed by the National Movement—they will take all measures necessary to exterminate the so-called naked culture movement.

In particular, I order the following:
i. Naked culture associations are to be kept under the closest watch...
```
As the text itself indicates, the associations were not <q>exterminated</q>. The overwhelming majority of nudists did not enroll in any organization anyway. Catholics' reactions to naturism was by far the fiercest, demonstrating the intrinsic opposition between antisexual Christianity and Germany's Pagan, pro-life tendencies. At most in 1933 a catholic civil servant passed a decree detailing precisely what underwear people had to wear, *essentially full-body costumes even for men*[^Bracht], which even ISIS' fanatical Islamists would probably laugh at. It got repealed *the very same year*.
```quote{cite="[Nudism in Nazi Germany: Indecent Behaviour or Physical Culture for the Well-being of the Nation](https://doi.org/10.1080/714001799)"}
 After the Nazis had outlawed many of the nudist organizations for lewdness in early 1933, the fascist, the apolitical and the commercial nudists united under the umbrella of the Nazi sport movement and became legal in late 1933. As a 'sport', with a Nazi MP as a new nudist 'Führer' the nudists improved their national standing. **_After the SS stood up openly for nudism, the anti-nudity laws no longer applied_**.
```
That was merely an occasion to take control of it and *root out communists and socialists* as usual. If the ideological vanguard of the regime, the SS, upholds something, there is really no arguing back. We notice the same general pattern as with the homosexual or Vandervögel movement. Outcries and passionate clamors with not nearly as much practical change as one might expect. This take over had ample justification to it too.
```quote{cite="idem" .aside}
there was also an entirely separate socialist naturism, united since 1928 under the heading *Proletarian Lifestyle Reform* und Free Physical Culture within the labor movement’s People’s Health Association (Verband Volksgesundheit).
```

The first generation of Nazis suffered from a reactionary Christian education exacerbated (understandably) by the excess of the Weimar republic, a striking reflection (decades before) of what modern sexual liberation<q>liberation</q> begat. Hitler among others, shared that mistake and in spades regards to women, considering them publicly as homemakers, period, with no right to take part in collective decisions or decide of their own destinies. All that was **men'** purview only. As thought Goebbels, Himmler, and everyone else among the higher-ups[^Goebbels].

"`quote{author="Adolf Hitler" cite="Monologe im Führerhauptquartier 1941–1944: Die Aufzeichnungen Heinrich Heims, ed. Werner Jochmann"}
In no local party group was a woman allowed to have even the smallest position [...](#) the political women appeared before me... they wanted to become members of the Reichstag in order to ennoble the customs there. I told them, [that](#) ninety-nine percent of all subjects of deliberation are men's things, which **_you [women](#) cannot judge_**. The more gallant you are towards a woman, the more you will *restrain her* from trying things she is not comfortable with. Everything that has to do with fighting and bloodshed is a matter for the man alone, he has to bear the final consequences.
```

Obviously, history shows that women can fight equally as well, just not the same way nor with the same weapons, and their nerves have no problem handling the sight of bloodsheds and massacres, as the example of Soviet's harpies is anything to buy. When your survival is at play, feelings cease to matter. And not just the war, but working in factories - while absolutely necessary for the war efforts - also was widely considered as unfitting for women, too masculinizing. Despite reassuring declarations that no one would sane consider keeping women at home as mere breeding machines[^Goebbels], they were effectively discouraged if not outright banned from participating in a gradually increased number of activities:
```quote{cite="[The Nazis, women and employment](https://www.tutor2u.net/history/reference/the-nazis-women-and-employment)"}
Whilst initially the Nazis used propaganda to encourage them to leave the workforce and focus on the home, the Nazis did introduce laws and policies which would remove and restrict women in the labor force.

For example from a young age, the Nazis taught girls that their place was in the home and were taught how to achieve this. They focused on lessons in housework such as cooking, needlework and ironing. They also studied racial science so that they would be able to pick suitable Ayran husbands in the future. In 1937 the Nazis banned girls from attending grammar schools which were seen as a way of encouraging girls into university.

Women faced restrictions from 1933 when the Nazis banned women from holding jobs in professional employment such as doctors and teachers. This was then extended in 1936 to include jobs within the justice system, which included the right to serve on a jury.

Because most of the primary sources are either in German and accessible only to specialists, or consisting in books not scanned anywhere on internet, and given that yours truly cannot pay 40€ per book to validate a single quotation however interesting, we chose to quote instead *The Pink Swastika*, by Scott Lively, Kevin Abrams. But I wish to stress: we know well enough that this book is riddled to the brim with unverifiable, ridiculous and hateful unfounded assumptions, and the authors are worth less than scum, basically seeing sodomites as the worst sinners imaginable, responsible for everything bad happening on Earth *ever*.

*Yet*, and this is where you must understand [our attitude regarding historical documents](DFN). If we assume a double-discours and strong hypocrisy, and a more important sexual deviancy not just in Nazi Germany but Nazi institutions themselves than what Himmler said, who is more likely to provide any source of information on this topic ? Neo-nazi reactionaries, most of them of reduced IQ, who wish nothing less than being related in any way to the current LGBT fad, or our very enemies ?

This is a strange yet common situation in which both sides of the political spectrum, at least their dominant representatives, Christian or not, share the so-called Christian values, marriage, homophobia, sexual repression etc. The Right has mostly been phagocytosed by Christian-minded if not Christian elements. So regardless of historical truth homosexuality (or whatever else deviant practice) will continue being a hot potato Conservatives and National-Socialists pass to another, as long as the latter still endorses Abrahamic sexual repression, that led to horrible practices such as infibulation and excision (yes, in the West) to guard children from temptation.

Hence because of their pollution by Christian ideology historical Nazi leaders have all the interest in the world to deny homosexuality, and can never be trusted. On the other hand our enemies can be trusted for digging out the slightest piece of inconvenient truth about ourselves, our past, glorious or not, though at the cost of twisting horribly. So if you want to uncover what we find inconvenient there is no better source of information than people ideologically opposed to us. Then, we have to either isolate the purely factual parts by accessing the primary source. Fairly easy most of the time. And when not possible, we must work to separate the interpretation from a kernel of likely factual truth.

But because this involves an interpretative work of our own, one can only purify the truth by by holding the correct theory or at least intuition, of *how things should be*. Without an inkling of where to look, one can search forever. And we know that our theory and intuitions are correct because it has been proved experimentally.
Early boy scouts organizations were rife with pederastic, homosexual relationships, as could attest Guy-Claude Burger. This wasn't much of a secret in France or the US, and this accusation (far from groundless) persisted up until now. However it has never been as explicitly and proudly assumed, even theorized, as in the romantic Wandervoegel group born at the end of XIXth century.

Hans Bluher became very influential in it after 1912, with the explicit wish to the Greek love ethos, uniting erotic attraction and transmission of values and knowledge. He also advocated for a militaristic, antisemitic and misogynistic society based on virile values[^bluher], which pederasty would sustain and develop. They created many of the symbolism, ethos and even costumes of Hitlerjugend[^Hitlerjugend], which absorbed them after 1933, even creating many of their rituals and symbolism. At its peak the movement as a whole reached 80 000 members, many of those seamlessly joined National-Socialist groups, the SA among others. Quite a few authors back then had similar ideas, such Adolf Brand or Friedlander, though the opinion on the role of heterosexual men and women as a whole would vary, from tolerance to denigration.

Since 1928 already, National-socialists often railed against homosexuality depicted as a Jewish conspiracy, while tolerating a few publically homosexual figures such as Röhms, while the Left, both before and after the war, accused them of the same very same thing, being a bunch of homosexuals, a recurring theme in 1930s left-wing propaganda. However, due to the phrasing of the law and Germans sticking to the words of the law, conviction required proving penetration through direct witnesses, and so were rare, and [even more rarely resulted in more than one year in jail sentence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_homosexuals_in_Nazi_Germany).

```quote{cite="[Sex and society in Nazi Germany, Hans Peter Bleuel, p119](https://books.google.de/books?id=pvfSAAAAIAAJ&hl=fr&source=gbs_book_other_versions)"
In 1934, the Gestapo reported forty cases of pederasty in just one troop of the Htiler Youth. Bleuel writes of the case of one supervisor, a 20-year-old man who was dismissed from the Hitler YOuth in 1938. Yet he was transferred to the National Socialist flying Corps (Civil air Patrol) <q>and was assigned to supervise work by members of the Hitler Youth Gliding Association and eventually detained to help with physical check-ups, a grievous temptation. The man was once again caught sodomizing young men, but was not dismissed from the NSFK
```

Conditions were essentially the same in 1941. Bleuel reports of another homosexual flying instructor involved in <q>at least ten cases of homosexuality with student pilots of the Hitler Youth</q> and <q>a student teacher and student... had committed twenty-eighty acts of indecency with twenty boys at Hitler Youth and Young Folk camps</q>. <q>These cases were only the tip of the iceberg, for few misdemeanors within the Party became public in later years and even fewer came to trial</q>.
In the light of this, we believe that persecution of homosexuals in Nazi Germany was not genuine. 40 years ago, more than half of all priests were full-on pedophiles acting whenever the occasion presented itself, so much that <q>pedophile priest</q> became a truism in the minds of people. Most people did not care, despite in truth knowing well enough. This was no different in Germany in 1928-1945, providing an excellent opportunity for Nazis to silence the Church, rabid political opponents. But fashy homos, could carry on with their kiddy fiddling however they liked.

Himmler and right-wing homophobic retards up until now, like to quote *Germanicus* from Tacitus. But the rest of the literature unilaterally describes both Celts and Germans specifically, as **preferring boys to girls**, in Christian as well as Pagan times[^pagan_times]. As for the *famous of quote of Tacitus constantly brought up by traditionalist degenerates*, I can not do justice to this splendid analysis apart from *quoting Julie Couronne*[^couronne], who debunks that myth eloquently. True pederasty, as Greeks vehemently asserted, on the contrary creates the most virile men from the cradle on masculine sodomitic embraces.

Historically the term sodomy used to mean <q>anything non-coital</q>, but it was also used more narrowly as *imperfect sodomy* (anal sex with women) and *perfect sodomy* (with men). But why even bother at all with what others do in their spare time ?
People react on an unconscious level, trying to uphold spiritual values, or what they perceive as the pole of transcendent and energy. The inner compulsion to make sense of the world prompted people to seek explanation to their state of existential distress, *due to the universal loss of our raw and psychically-endowed original state*.
The definite number one cause of this Fall in the realm of sexuality, is coitus, as it represents as much as embodies everything wrong with our way of love, as the ultimate expression of *breeding overdrive*. Sodomy just appears to be the most related and similar-looking contact. As a fellow penile penetration moreover in a very close hole, the fantasy can appear pretty much interchangeable.

Besides, normal people always sought scapegoats to blame for their mistakes. Male homosexuals have consistently been singled out, lesbians being rather left out or ignored (with some rare exceptions), up to Nazi Germany, in which despite some debates, specialists couldn't see an issue with those <q>antinatural behaviors</q> as women were still free to marry and make kids. Not with men though.

Overall, the ambiguous German attitude toward sexuality, is representative of the incapacity of Hitler, or the regime itself, to take a definite public stance on a number of social topics, resulting in widely inconstant policies impossible to make head or tail of without the precise political context of the *year*. Sometimes repressive, sometimes eerily in line with usual anarchist or communist stances against bourgeois squeamishness regarding the naked body, sex and pleasure. Hitler changed his time several times, or rather he never had a strong opinion he deemed necessary to enforce on his people, leaving them (meaning, his party members and relevant associations) to decide on their own[^pleasure].

By that somewhat mirroring though in an inverted social context Lenin's attitude, outwardly very conservative (though inwardly contradictory considering his living with two women for a time and death from **syphilis**) but unwilling to exercise his authority against the free-for-all sexual morale the Soviet youth adopted initially, despite being highly critical of it.
The discovery of instinctotherapy and the original function of love, would have played out very, very differently. It would have led to a (mostly) peaceful crusade for millions of people, toward an unending improvement for humankind.

**In a nutshell, we lost a whole century of progress.**

	Until recently, Xenophon has generally been preferred because he was an eyewitness to the events that he describes and because his former association with the oligarchs did not prevent him from exposing their atrocities. However, scholars have increasingly raised questions about Xenophon’s portrayal of the Thirty for placing the installation of the Spartan garrison too early in their rule, for overlooking or downplaying the importance of the constitutional reforms that the oligarchs wanted to implement, or for exaggerating Critias’ influence over his fellow oligarchs. Xenophon is thought to have made Critias, in particular, and the Thirty, in general, appear more extreme, so he could distance himself and other moderate oligarchs from their rule. Thus, it is thought that Xenophon does not provide an accurate account of the vision or the long-term goals of the Thirty because he disregards their political efforts to transform Athens. He merely depicts them as brutal tyrants seeking to exploit the Athenian defeat for their own per-sonal gain.

	Historical records are sparse regarding the population growth of Athens through the fourth century BCE. Athens ruled the smaller towns of Attica, making it the largest and wealthiest of the city-states on the Greek mainland, eclipsing Sparta. The size of its population at any one time is based largely on speculation, but during the fifty years between repelling the invasion of the Persians (480 BCE) and the beginning of the Peloponnesian War (431 BCE), its *population more than doubled. By 430 BCE Athens was densely populated, with over 100 persons per square mile of land*.

	Plato noted that as more and more of the land of Attica was deforested for farming, land was lost to erosion and the environment was permanently altered. To Plato, *the state was destroying itself through unrestricted population growth*. The *Peloponnesian war*, which was *caused in part by overpopulation*, led to a new imbalance in Attica, caused by the losses of so many young men of the population in battle, and the plague which struck the region in 425 BCE.

	[...](#) But [Aristote](#) observed that families which grew beyond the means of the parents to support them regardless of circumstances were inevitably reduced to poverty. To Aristotle, the equitable sharing of land should be accompanied by regulation “of the number of children in the family”. Aristotle also warned overpopulation led to increased poverty and crime, and thus the state must regulate reproduction rates for its own protection.

	<q>If no restriction is imposed on the rate of reproduction, and this is the case in most of our existing states, poverty is the inevitable result; and poverty produces in its turn, civic dissension and wrongdoing</q>, warned Aristotle. He cited Crete’s government’s segregation of women to prevent them from having too many children as an example of population control. <q>A great state is not the same as a populous state</q>, he warned.

[^jung_weiniger]: Carl Gustav Jung had little expectation nor hope for women:
	```quote
	The feminine mind is the earth waiting for the seed.
	Anything you acquire by your own efforts is worth a hundred years with a woman analyst
	```
	While Otto Weininger had seen even **clearer**.
	```quote {cite="Sex and Character" author="Otto Weiniger"}
	The vanity of women is, then, always in relation to others; a woman lives only in the thoughts of others about her. The sensibility of women is directed to this. A woman never forgets that someone thought her ugly; a woman never considers herself ugly; the successes of others at the most only make her think of herself as perhaps less attractive. But no woman ever believes herself to be anything but beautiful and desirable when she looks at herself in the glass; she never accepts her own ugliness as a painful reality as a man would, and never ceases to try to persuade others of the contrary.
	What is the source of this form of vanity, peculiar to the female? It comes from the absence of an intelligible ego [by <q>ego</q> he means the Self, not ego as in <q>egocentrism</q>](#), the only begetter of a constant and positive sense of value; it is, in fact, that she is devoid of a sense of personal value. As she sets no store by herself or on herself, she endeavors to attain a value in the eyes of others by exciting their desire and admiration. The only thing which has any absolute and ultimate value in the world is the soul. <q>Ye are better than many sparrows</q> were Christ’s words to mankind. A woman does not value herself by the constancy and freedom of her personality; but this is the only possible method for every creature possessing an ego. But if a real woman, and this is certainly the case, can only value herself at the rate of the man who has fixed his choice on her; if it is only through her husband or lover that she can attain to a value not only in social and material things, but also in her innermost nature, it follows that she possesses no personal value, she is devoid of man’s sense of the value of his own personality for itself.
	**And so women always get their sense of value from something outside themselves**, from their money or estates, the number and *richness of their garments*, the position of their box at the opera, *their children*, and, above all, their husbands or lovers. When a woman is quarreling with another woman, her final weapon, and the weapon she finds most effective and discomfiting, is to proclaim her superior social position, her wealth or title, and, above all, her youthfulness and the devotion of her husband or lover; *whereas a man in similar case would lay himself open to contempt if he relied on anything except his own personal individuality*.

	But it is in the practice of the sexual use of children that earlier Japanese excelled even more than Germans and Austrians. Imperial incest was common, and Japanese fathers until recently would often marry their daughters after the death of their wives, considering incest a *praiseworthy* pratique.

	Because Japanese husbands so rarely come home at night—going to geisha or other women for sex—the mothers are desperately lonely, and so routinely co-sleeping with their children <q>skin to skin</q> (nude, dakine) and co-bathing until they were grown up. Even today, many Japanese mothers masturbate their children in public, in bed <q>to put them to sleep</q> and during co-bathing, sometimes promising to let them have intercourse with them if they do well on their next school test. 

	The average Japanese mother sleeps with her children until they are ten or fifteen years old, traditionally sleeping *skin-to-skin* (dakine) while embracing her child because the father - as in the traditional gynarchy - is usually absent, over two-thirds of Japanese husbands being involved in extramarital intercourse.

	The light touch at 11.11 may indicate a *certain delicacy and reticence in dealing with sexual matters*, but it is essentially **jocular**, suggesting that so far from being unable to attain a sexual liaison of the kind he wants, *Hiero will have to put up with plenty of unsolicited offers*. This hints at opportunities for *discriminating choice*, rather than promiscuity, but *does not imply abstention from sex altogether*. Indeed, *the possibility of more than one lover* is probably implied in the reference to *παϊδας* in 11.14. The tyrant's services so far mentioned in chapter 11 are in the public domain, but a more personal concern for friends and lovers is urged at the ensuing 14, which enjoins him to treat his *παϊδας* as his own life.

	A paragraph or two earlier *the promise of male lovers has been held out to the good tyrant*. [...](#) When, at the close of the dialogue, Xenophon comes to depict the character of the good tyrant, *his male lovers are included within the scope of his beneficence*.

	Taken as a whole, the various references in the Hiero present what may be regarded as an idealized view of homosexual love. They depict _a way of moderation and regard for the beloved, **a combination of the physical and the ethical**_, which we have now seen to run through Xenophon's writings, and *which, it may be claimed, was Xenophon's own view of the matter*. It may be unattainable by the unreconstructed tyrant, but remains as an ideal for the ruler (and, presumably for any of his subjects) who is willing to show concern for his fellow men.

	In Mein Kampf Hitler had attacked the ‘saint’s cloak of prudishness’worn by the bourgeoisie, and his sympathy for other aspects of lifestyle reform such as vegetarianism and abstinence was well-known, yet he had also attacked the Weimar Republic as a ‘hothouse of sexual ideas and stimuli’. The conflicts and uncertainty within the Nazi régime over the issue of naturism were therefore typical of the many areas of policy where the Führer was unwilling or unable to commit himself to a public position. In the absence of a definitive order from above, lower-ranking figures in the National Socialist hierarchy were able to play out their own tastes and prejudices, and these varied widely: ‘some did indeed want a return to more conservative values and behaviors, but many others worked to detach emancipatory impulses from their association with “Marxism” and “Jewishness” and to redefine sexual liberation as a “Germanic”, “Aryan” prerogative.’
	
	But who knows was the next generation, raised to value strength and independence of thought, would have decided ? What kind of culture would they create ? We will never know but we believe something great, increasingly closer to their Nordic heritage, discarding old prejudices.. Such a people would have been open to social change on a rational basis, much more that has been the case in the democratic new world order.

	It is not because we see the woman as inferior but because we see her as having a different mission, a different value, than that of man. Therefore, we believe that women, and above all the German woman, who more than any other in the world is a woman in the best sense of the word, should rally her strengths and apply her abilities in other areas than the man.
	
	Even today, the role of women in public life is no different than it was in the past. No one who understands the modern age would have the ludicrous idea of *driving woman from public life, from work, from her profession and from breadwinning*. But it must also be said that those things that belong to man must remain his. And that includes politics and the military. This is not to disparage women, only to delegate her abilities and talents to those sectors of labor and activity that are most suited to her essential nature.

	During this famous speech delivered at the ϟϟ-Junkerschule in Bad Tölz, the Reichsführer asserted that the Ancient Germans drowned their homosexuals in foul-smelling bogs, relying for this on the <q>De Origine et Situ Germanorum</q> of the Latin historian Tacitus, short treatise written in 98 BC. The exact sentence is
	> Proditores et transfugas arboribus hang, ignauos et imbelles et corpore infames caeno ac palude, iniecta insuper crate, mergunt
	
	Translating *literally* to:
	> Traitors and deserters are hanged from trees, as for cowards and **those who use their bodies infamously**, they are plunged into the mud of a swamp, taking care to throw a wicker grid over them.
	
	The Reichsführer therefore peremptorily interpreted <q>corpore infames</q>, that is, <q>those who use their bodies infamously</q>, by <q>homosexual</q>. However, this interpretation is inadmissible for two reasons.
	– First of all, homosexuality was not considered dishonorable in these pre-Christian eras; what was, was homosexual rape, which victorious warriors often inflicted on defeated soldiers, and it was the <q>rape</q> aspect that was, because rape is always dishonorable whether it is homosexual or heterosexual. However, in the sentence there is no mention of sexual coercion. It is clearly specified <q>those who do</q> and not <q>those who suffer</q>.
	– Which brings us to the second objection: there is, in fact, no question of sex at all, but only of cowardice by the refusal to go into battle. Sexuality, homo- or hetero-, has nothing to do with its explanation. It must also be considered that Tacitus uses the Latin syntax to describe the mores of these Barbarians, and that semantically in Roman infamia was a lifelong stigma inflicted by the censors, which may consist of physical mutilation. These organized drownings were therefore a punishment inflicted on men who mutilated themselves to make themselves unfit for combat - an act that will be found during the Napoleonic era, for example, where young people cut off their index and middle fingers. right hand <q>by accident</q> so as not to be able to shoot a rifle, or a few toes so as not to be able to take long walks, and therefore avoid being recruited. The text of Tacitus speaks of cowards and cowards, and that is why they are punished, not for their sexuality. <q>Using one's body infamously</q> therefore means, in this context, <q>deliberately inflicting injury on oneself to render oneself unfit for war</q>.

	Ancient Greek society was full of varying personalities and opinions on a variety of topics, and pederasty was no exception. There were groups that accepted and even preferred pederasty. There were others that could tolerate the practice, but disliked the passive's role. On the opposite side of the spectrum, there were the groups of people that did not accept pederasty at all.
	Some men in ancient Greece believed pederasty was an acceptable activity and that it should be used with frequency. It seems the elite were the main people who participated in pederasty and were the ones who supported it. Other groups of people who supported pederasty were philosophers and men who regularly attended the gymnasiums.
	Plutarch's Moralia stated:
	> but you will see it [love of boys] plain and unaffected in philosophical schools or I suppose in the gymnasium and wrestling-schools, *in the hunt for boys, with a shrill and noble call, urging to virtue the boys worthy of its concern*.

	I think I ought to say something also about intimacy with boys, since this matter also has a bearing on education. In other Greek states, for instance among the Boeotians, man and boy live together, like married people; elsewhere, among the Eleians, for example, consent is won by means of favors. Some, on the other hand, entirely forbid suitors to talk with boys.

	The customs instituted by Lycurgus were opposed to all of these. If someone, being himself an honest man, admired a boy's soul and tried to make him an ideal friend without reproach and to associate with him, he approved, and believed in the excellence of this kind of training. But if it was clear that the attraction lay in the boy's outward beauty, he banned the connection as an abomination; and thus he caused lovers to abstain from boys no less than parents abstain from sexual intercourse with their children and brothers and sisters with each other.

	I am not surprised, however, that people refuse to believe this. For in many states the laws are not opposed to the indulgence of these appetites. I have now dealt with the Spartan system of education, and that of the other Greek states. Which system turns out men more obedient, more respectful, and more strictly temperate, anyone who chooses may once more judge for himself.

	All told, holiday leisure time in medieval England took up probably about one-third of the year. And the English were apparently working harder than their neighbors. The ancient règime in France is reported to have guaranteed fifty-two Sundays, ninety rest days, and thirty-eight holidays. In Spain, travelers noted that holidays totaled five months per year.

	The peasant's free time extended beyond officially sanctioned holidays. There is considerable evidence of what economists call the backward-bending supply curve of labor -- the idea that when wages rise, workers supply less labor. During one period of unusually high wages (the late fourteenth century), many laborers refused to work <q>by the year or the half year or by any of the usual terms but only by the day</q>. And they worked only as many days as were necessary to earn their customary income -- which in this case amounted to about 120 days a year, for a probable total of only 1,440 hours annually (this estimate assumes a 12-hour day because the days worked were probably during spring, summer and fall). A thirteenth-century esteem finds that whole peasant families did not put in more than 150 days per year on their land. **Manorial records from fourteenth-century England indicate an extremely short working year -- 175 days -- for servile laborers. Later evidence for farmer-miners, a group with control over their work-time, indicates they worked only 180 days a year.**

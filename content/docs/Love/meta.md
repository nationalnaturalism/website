Meta­psychoanalysis is a scientific formalization describing the structure of our original love instincts, as expressed within the original diet conditions for which we evolved. It appears that the end of chemical disturbance of the brain gives access to a greatly appeased state of consciousness, which has proved to be our natural state. Sexual impulses calm down, ending the rule of the so-called hormonal pressure, the imperious physiological need to **fuck** all suffer from, men in particular.
In this context meta­psychoanalysis emerged: A theory overturning all human psychology and materialism and demonstrating the systematic apparition of extrasensory faculties such as visions of the past, present or future and telepathy. It postulates (as supported by observations of primates and dolphins) that the primary function of the (natural) sexual impulses is not reproduction but the creation and exchange of a <q>numinous</q> energy to access these abilities reliably.

*This paradigmatic shift in our very perception of reality could be the foundation of a new science at last growing out of its materialistic diapers.*
We do not make the claim that psychic abilities are real... others already [won this battle](spirituality#survey_psychic) on the scientific ground, with numerous evidences. For all intent and purpose the Psi makes no statistical doubt anymore.

But **this**, is to [go even further beyond](https://youtu.be/8TGalu36BHA?t=2), into **magic**.

## The absolute state of love

### Lies of Normal sexuality

We are taught that the perfect union involves a man and a woman couple, around the same age, from distant famiies... While some fetishes are considered <q>natural</q>, evolutionary-driven ([grown-ass women with big milky tits](.#fat_ass), the quintessential degrading maternal regression), others aren't. While denying the ubiquity of homosexual couplings in nature has become impossible, it still doesn't have any explanation better than the libido doesn't really discriminate as long as that excess sexuality doesn't undermine *enough* the fitness under natural selection[^al].

Meaning that these behaviors do not present any particular purpose, *a waste of energy by a wasteful nature*, a conclusion (not theirs) not difficult to draw and strangely in tune with early 19th and 20th century's moralists' represive attitude. Far from helping, this kind of hypothesis merely demonstrates the limitation of a materialistic conception of evolution and natural selection. Other *perversions* show even less interest despite their widespread character in the animal world.

Scientific considerations aside, we must acknowledge the reality that *love today just isn't what our aspirations crank it up to be*, and has been fraud with deceptions and conflicts since [the dawn of human history](.#vagina_dentata). More prosaically, tensions inevitably build up from intimacy and the best partners with the best personality imaginables, always end up bashing each other's head against the wall out of frustration, sometimes literally.
We name those instinctive psychic backlashes <q>Excalibur</q> impulses. Normally aimed at reestablishing balance in troubled inter-individual relationships, they often only cause further unrest, as said troubles unlike in nature are not merely accidental (a matter of <q>misunderstandings</q> or singular <q>evil</q>) but **chemical**, structural, hence bound to repeat themselves no matter what **as long as the lifestyle itself has not been corrected**.
{#excalibur}

<q>Sexual alchemy</q> is a myth, statistics showing the omnipresence of fake orgasms among heterosexual women, versus homosexual ones. And what better  evidence of a monumental faillure do we need to reconsider our whole approach ?

Some can try to persuade themselves (<q>I always fuck them well </q>). But men are easy to deceive, too  in their dick's narcissism. Studies show them blissfully unaware of when girls simulate or not.

```quote{.aside cite="[How Many Women Fake Orgasms? [2023 Data REVEAL ALL!]](https://sexualalpha.com/how-many-women-fake-orgasms/)"}
#### Top Fake Orgasm Statistics You Should Know

* 70% of women experience orgasms exclusively from clitoral stimulation.
* 13-14% of women have never had an orgasm or weren’t sure if they had.
* Women who made more money than their partners were twice as likely to fake orgasms than women who did not make more money than their partners.
42.4% of women faked orgasms because they didn’t want to hurt a partner’s feelings.
* A whopping 80% of women faked orgasms during vaginal intercourse.
* Women are *10 times more likely than men to say they only rarely reached their peak*.
* FOD (Female Orgasmic Disorder), which results in the lack of orgasms, affects up to 28% of women in the United States and up to 46% in countries across Asia.
```

This elucidates the eagerness of giving into the G spot myth, that sacro-saint place of worship which could magically save coitus, *the most single-minded and enduring obsession of humanity*. Suddenly all the sour but accurate feminist complains of the 70s and 80s were promptly invalidated by an elusive G spot *and the obsession of vaginal intercourse justified again* even though said discovery [hasn't been replicated yet.](https://www.livescience.com/17977-spot-science-find-60-years-study.html "G-Spot: Science Can't Find It After 60 Years, Study Says (2012)")

Men once again could forget about the clitoris.
{.important}

This baffling disregard for their feminine partner and unwillingness to see the elephant in the room men routinely show, testifies not only to the ignorance of the much wider wealth of sexual contacts in nature, but also that there must be a *common reason for that incompatibility in sex*, which all cultures so far have show the signs of. 

**Children** should be taught how their body works and how pleasure is obtained. This alone, would solve the issue of teen pregnancies, as basically for psychological health it matters not **how** orgasm pleasure is reached, **but that it is indeed reached efficiently and often**.

It is astoundingly, breath-takingly excruciating to see how today, most women are not and do not know how to be satisfied, hence living continuously unfulfilling lives... Which explains the age-old tendency in civilized societies, of women fantasizing about invaders and welcoming them in their bed. Like today's feminists pinning for filthy swarthy Middle Easterners or Negroes. Or hundreds years ago, with Jewish or Muslim women eagerly going for Christians. To us this incredible and irrational phenomena (for racial strangers *fuck* much worse than sensitive White men, quite systematically so) merely reflects the age-old longing for greener pastures, for exoticism, itself predicated on an unfulfilled desire which lies beyond the sex act itself (for men always also fantasized about foreigners from the West Indies in particular, and now Chinese and Japanese).

As long as sexuality doesn't fulfill its most important role - that is to provide both orgasmic and metapsychic satisfaction - the race and the State will never be safe from the threat of racial contamination, stemming from within.
{{% /expurged %}}

For centuries, under the terrifying, woefully oppressive yoke of the Catholic Church, people were more sexually free and happy than we are. They never forgot that pleasure comes mostly from the foreskin in the case of men, and only from the **clitoris** in the case of women. Sodomy might have been viewed as devilish, but it was practiced just as much according to the records, and without repercussion in most cases. They knew how to please themselves, be pleased and please others, and did so guilt-free.

Once young people know what to do and what to expect of a real love life, they will be free to seek their own happiness, and not be deceived or resign in accepting a miserable fate within the confines of a frustrating marital relation.

But even <q>liberated</q> heterosexual women who do take care of their orgasms, aren't necessarily happy, nor they do find a sense of completion, drive and enthusiasm for life, any more than men do. *Something is lacking in sex, regardless of the amount we get*.

As for men, they quickly loose interest in a body they went in more than a few times and quickly enough needs more and more variety in lovemaking with ridiculous positions that change nothing, down to the grotesques range of sex-toys and degrading exposition of anatomical oddities porn movies are full of today. Logic also entails that the libido drive would automatically shut down when women are either to old to breed or visibly pregnant, or otherwise not objectively fertile, as is the case for nearly all animals save for the very same few that share our <q>perversions</q>.

Our mistake has always been to think reproduction was the <q>natural</q> purpose of sexuality and merely diverted for egoistic pleasure, and while in our lineage (and a few others) it has always been the acquisition of a metapsychic energy fuelling psychic abilities.

### Metapsychic energy

That energy has various names in all cultures, but always has one, at least when such cultures hasn't developped a paranoid fear of the supernatural as in countries of Christian, Muslim and Jewish faith. A term that sticked in anthropology, from studies of Melanesian and Polynesian, is that of <q>mana</q>. We should accept the fact that "Primitives" more often than not, are and were no stupider than us, and much more rational in their worldview than us. And much readier to acknowledge what they don't understand *without flat-out denying its existence like modern zeteticians*. While their science laged behind ours - obviously - relying on the supernatural (for explanations or help) did not necessarily come as a clutch to supplement their loosy intellect. On the contrary, so-called primtiive people, had sometimes a keen understanding of the two different orders of things, the material and the supernatural[^graham].

[^graham]:
	```quote{author="Elisabeth Graham" cite="[Do you believe in magic ?](https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10052838/3/Graham_Do%20You%20Believe%20in%20Magic%20v2.pdf)"}
	Malinowski and Evans-Pritchard simply made the point that the Trobrianders and Azande lived in a more logical world than had theretofore been attributed to <q>primitives</q>, but this still left room for magic and witchcraft as viable terms. Witchcraft of course is our word. Mangu is the Zande term for the substance found in a person’s body that gives that person the capacity for what we call witchcraft, and boro mangu is someone who possesses and uses this capacity.
	```

This immaterial energy can only be produced with form of love that poets, philosophers (Plato the first) and ancient spiritual traditions of every past culture under the Sun described.
- The Etruscans (prevalent in Italy before the advent of Rome) were famous in antiquity for their complete absence of love taboos, as well as for their <q>manticians</q>, true precognitives requiring no rituals.
- Persian priests were also renowned for their wisdom, both from their [centuries-old habit of incestuous marriage](incest#persia) over several generations.
- Although in an ever degrading, diminutive form, it still persisted in Europe until fairly recently, before the Industrial the Revolution[^rollet].
- Even today, the proportion of homosexuals or polygamists of all kinds among artists (music, cinema, fashion designers) far exceeds that of the ordinary public, and the most inspired/popular, the gayest, in a sort of concentric circle.
- Lastly, specialists in parapsychology know for a fact that <q>child molestation</q> **nearly always features** in the childhood of <q>gifted subjects</q> (mediums).

Metapsychic energy and the symbols it conveys --- a sense of cosmic significance always playing out even with the most physical manifestations --- fits Plato's and Jung's descriptions of **Archetypes** perfectly:
```quote{author="C.W Jung", cite="Mind and Earth"}
[¶43](#) But the full extent of these *projections from the unconscious* became known through analysis of those obscure and inexplicable feelings and emotions which give some *intangible*, *magical quality to certain places*, certain *moods of nature*, certain *works of art*, and also to *certain ideas and certain people*. *This magic likewise comes from projection, but a projection of the collective unconscious.* If it is inanimate objects that have the “magical” quality, often their mere statistical incidence is sufficient to prove that their significance is due to the projection of a mythological content from the collective unconscious.

[¶53](#) Archetypes are *systems of readiness for action*, and at the same time *images* and *emotions*. They are inherited with the brain-structure—indeed, they are its psychic aspect. They represent, on the one hand, a very strong instinctive conservatism, while on the other hand they are the most effective means conceivable of instinctive adaptation.
```

But cooking (food processing in general) made this sensibility and connection to a higher order of existence all but disappear, along with polymorphic sexual instincts key to fuel them, inducing a paradoxical and pathological brain wiring from birth.
According to stats, 92% of the population at large describes its practice as pure normalcy: Non-pedophilic, non-incestuous heterosexuality. While the norm for our closest cousins and many top-tier species regards to intelligence (cetaceans),is more than [70% of contacts being homosexual](homofascism#majority_homo), which means that all individuals have on the regular contacts with both sex, and means a 100% bisexual population. This huge and almost planetary discrepancy, comes from this forceful rerouting of all polymorphic urges and libido into breeding behaviors, namely coitus.

There is no question about the blatant excess of heterosexuality in our species due to exciting substances, first and foremost denatured molecules, aka cooking. Decades of observations showed the significant direct effect of cooking in ramping up animal baser animal impulses, among them heterosexual desire in particular coital fantasies. The reason being these fantasies are not merely acquired conditioning but instinctive impulses recorded in the deepest depths of our brain and DNA and appeared along our phylogenetic line before homosexual (or polymorphic in general, which includes anything without immediate procreative purpose) instincts developed.

The precise nature of our sexual issues, at least the most urgent one, lies in people seeking happiness in such distorted impulses, and romanticizing, idealizing them, in the end which leads to the model of harems or nuclear families while only 3-5% of all species of mammals that are monogamous, and hardly any of them actually live in truly <q>faithful</q> couples. And all those do also feature infidelities by both partners, females included.

This phenomena is an immediate consequence of denatured molecules acting on the brain generating an *excessive attraction to all traits (inner or outer) in a partner that are innately associated with the breeding scheme*.

From a male perspective, this means a hard-on for symbols of fertility (big booty) or the female submissiveness to her <q>alpha</q> male.
{.important #fat_ass}

It also stacks up with time, creating a paradoxal heterosexual structure we then automatically believe to be natural and not learned. We get used to these unnatural urges to fuck (for men) or breed (mostly for girls, since early childhood causing things like the fixation on dolls) *creating in every person* growing up under the influence of cooking *whole personality traits at odds with our instinctive programming*.

On top of that, the Oedipus complex [of which we talk below](.#oedipus) intervenes, building up on that accumulating exacerbated libido, cementing the fixation on maternal figures. Something similar happens with women too but less so, making for a blurrier limit between love and friendships among women. As diet only worsened in the long run (because of the lack of rationalism and formalization of the issue), culture could only stray further and further away.

Degenerate Amerimutts (or niggers) jacking off to the worse porn for years, while drinking beverages probably less healthy as acid battery at this point, biologically lost the cerebral sensibility for metasexuality the same way epileptics can not play the violin.

On the contrary, talking from experience the most striking aspect of a relationship loaded with energy, is the constant feeling of consciousness expansion. It seems like the other person is part of ourselves, as if our consciousness extended to it, and more. Obviously this impression is at its peak when we make love, for metasexuality is the evolutionary co-opting by evolution of the intense contact of mucosa and exchange of fluids occuring with sexuality, as physical vectors of energy[^oo].

Everything we see looks *different, richer in tone, hues and shape, carrying yet unforeseen meanings we can't quite pinpoint or label with words*. As if reminding us of things we had forgotten until then. The world is transfigurated. Songs like [Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Every_Little_Thing_She_Does_Is_Magic) or [Rosanna](https://genius.com/Toto-rosanna-lyrics) explore that state although usually (read: *in the culinary referential*) it can only be attained sporadically, in rare spurts only frustrating even more that no technique can latch onto.

This state of consciousness is the hallmark of the metapsychic program, whose very purpose is the expansion of consciousness. Sex itself, is transfigurated. Sensations are much more powerful, they last longer, and keep you satisfied for the whole day (or several) on both the organic level and metapsychic or spiritual level. The mere remembrance of magical liaison can sustain us for long periods of erotic starvation, as it did with Guy‑Claude in prison.

It is not about reaching orgasm anymore (though it does come eventually, in all its mind-blowing glory), our mind can *breath* and focus on subtle sensations or not focusing at all, just <q>letting go</q>. My point is, there is no need to <q>think</q> anymore, things just happen on their own, *bodies move on their accords*, fantasies pop up at the right moment, with little to no words to be uttered.

Having multiple partners is very much appreciated, but *not as a way to cope with boredom*. We understand *love as an exchange of consciousness-information*, hence more partners can mean more knowledge, but only in the right state of mind, in the right energetic circumstances. In those circumstances *we learn to talk directly and receive its answers through visions*.

**But on the other hand:**
Because the purpose of our existence is spiritual, because we are wired for metasexuality, behaving like cows and roosters, spending our time breeding and raising kids as a means to an end like any inferior animal does (instead of an extension or a function of energy, to increase beauty or consciousness on Earth and enact destiny) actively depletes our energy level, with depression as a result. Indeed depression is not a chemical brain imbalance but the feeling of an inner lack, *the lack of the literal soul stuff*, which hurts more deeply than any food shortage, especially when no one has any clue about the causes.

Roosters do not suffer from chasing females half of the day, because Nature wills it... For that reason their ridiculous prideful character doesn't feel off nor dysfunctional.
{.important .aside}

In the elated state of consciousness metasexuality aims at and induces, all notions such as age or sex are discarded, only beauty - inner *and* outer - matters, *and the burning need make the world a better life*, expressing the eternal archetypal Essences we are both drawing from and drawn to. I can assert from both theory and experience, that the biggest problem - beside cooking - which makes those relationships very difficult to maintain, is the constant inner work they require, **lest energy and the mindboggling sex to gradually disappear, as resentment and enmity settle**.

More than five consecutive decades of observations showed that a free exercise of what Freud called <q>polymorphisms</q> - anything not seen in human and apes and outside coitus constitute the perfect conditions an advanced and eerily precise form of clairvoyance, in which it sufficed to merely *ask* questions, *any* question,  and see the reply in a visual sense... sometimes hear it.
These facts are nothing new in history: such relationships or disinhibited love in general (which does include cases of heterosexuality) were often labelled as being the source of magic, witchcraft, divine inspirations, with extreme regularity. European Middle-Age, Ancient Egypt, Greek-Roman civilization, Celts, the whole of Asia.

Ranging from repairing complex electronic devices by seeing the single transistor needing replacement, or divining the exact place of turtle eggs in three coordinates - longitudinal, latitudinal distance _plus depth_ - in a vast sand beach, foretelling up to the decimal the exact selling figure to predict the year's budget in an import company, or obtaining precise on several months of someone's life several thousand kilometers away.

```quote {autor="Guy‑Claude Burger" cite="Essay on metasexuality" .important .aside}
Theorizing occurred very spontaneously, with observations in a hitherto unknown dietary context that could be called <q>preculinary referential</q>. The radical change in eating habits and elimination of all the stimulants present in common foods: gluten (cereals), exorphins (milk), caffeine, theobromine (chocolate), alcohol, AGE etc., made possible wholly unprecedented observations under cooking’s rule. Those taking part in this unusual experience saw their sexual excitability change dramatically. It was thus possible to bring out what can be called *the natural laws of human sexuality* and to highlight unknown - or generally hidden - relationships between amorous behavior and the development of extrasensory faculties.
```

While extremely impressive the required conditions explain why these things are so rare today even in seemingly <q>correct</q> relationships. *The extrasensory requires a very calm nervous system, undisturbed by cooking-related excitants*, and so, maintaining dietary discipline to a T over the years, a feat few over the time have proved capable of.
To realize one is subject to [feedback](instincto#def_feedback_effect) (not thinking straight and taking everything out of proportion) from within is close to impossible. It requires a strong dose of metacognition (seeing oneself thinking, from above) and the memory of previous mental states, a facet of intelligence rather dismissed by our culture obsessed with facts and action and filling our minds rather than knowing them...

The self-increasing cacophony of thoughts not kept in checked anymore by natural regulations (by **reality**) leads to madness and mental exhaustion. Usually asking others if we behave in a disturbed (read: annoying) way is the surest way to know, much like in Naturo the way we get out of a genjutsu by getting teammates to inject chakra in our system.

In the biblical sense, the processing of food (*especially with heat*) has caused the <q>Fall</q> of our culture, and this Fall is reproduced in all relationships, at all orgasms in the wrong places, at the wrong times and with the wrong psychic position. It is reproduced at every puberty.

![illustration of feedback aping Shining](/Images/meta/shining_parody.webp)

Sexual activities being mainly driven by coarse chaotic impulses, we do not know how to properly make love, nor do we usually care or wish to learn it: years of (insufficient) education or feminist efforts in <q>progressive</q> Western  countries to highlight this perpetual issue of men's just wanting to cum, convinced of their all-mighty virile member's divine power to give pleasure to women.

### Natural Perversions {#in-nature}

Genital contacts between same-sex individuals for pleasure has been observed in more than 51 non-human primate species, while enduring same-sex couples are common in [macaques](www.doi.org/10.1007/BF01540994 "Macaca fuscata, S. Male-Female, Female-Female, and Male-Male sexual behavior in the stumptail monkey, with special attention to the female orgasm (2014)"), orangu-tans, [bonobos](www.doi.org/10.1006/anbe.2000.1451 "Use and function of genital contacts among female bonobos, Hohmann and Fruth (2000)"), gorillas and chimpanzees. Gorillas which live either in [male-only groups](www.doi.org/10.1111/J.1439-0310.1996.TB01172.X "Robbins MM. Male-male interactions in heterosexual and all-male wild mountain gorilla groups (2010)") or harems of one or a few males with [many females](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27167861/ "Homosexual Behavior in female mountain gorillas, Cyril C. Grueter, and Tara S. Stoinski (2016)") also exhibit homosexual activity culminating with orgasms like ours.

![ss](/Images/biology/homosex_gorilla_2_g-g.webp)

![dd](/Images/biology/homosex_gorilla.webp)

```quote{#majority_homo cite="The cooperative sex: Sexual interactions among female bonobos are linked to increases in oxytocin, proximity and coalitions" author="Moscovice, Liza R. et al."}
The majority of sexual events (65%) consisted of female same-sex genito-genital rubbing (or GG-rubbing). Female dyads engaged in significantly more sexual interactions than did inter-sexual dyads, and females were more likely to remain within close proximity to their partners following GG-rubbing.

*The emergence of habitual same-sex sexual behavior may have been an important step in the evolution of cooperation outside of kinship and pair-bonds in one of our closest phylogenetic relatives*.
```

Multiple lifestyles exist or co-exist among our closest cousins, among others mountain gorillas which live either in male-only groups where males are mostly heteros when in a harem, and only homo while in all-male groups, while females exhibit as much lesbianism in harems.
It appears that bonobo females are first and foremost homosexual, with the occasional kids popped out every 5 years. Given how they go at it all the week all year-long just like us I would argue that 95% of all touchings are non-procreative, including most heterosexual encounters, and most coitus as well, though the overwhelming majority of contacts are not coital. Chimpanzees, the second closest apes don't feature nearly as much sexual proclivity in general but contrary to what has been believed for a long time their sociosexual behaviors do include a [similar frequency of homosexual contacts](https://doi.org/10.1163/1568539X-bja10062 "Sociosexual behaviour in wild chimpanzees occurs in variable contexts and is frequent between same-sex partners (2021)"), observed for all ages and genders, with---not to our surprise---a marked preference for age-gaps.

More general attempts at re-contextualizing described those behaviors not just as adaptive idiosyncrasies of a few species but as a pervasive evolutionary tendency have been undertaken since then. This extensive bonds-creating property of homosexuality was noticed and commented upon again and again in history, among the latest and best expounder being Adolf Brand, publishing *the Eigene* from 1896 to 1933. At a time where degeneracy reigned supreme and what would become the LGBTI religion (from transsexualism and faggotry united as [one](germany#hirschfield) started *representing* all homosexuals, granting themselves an undue right which quite frankly played in the reactionaries' hand, eager to demonize everyone in the name of God or what stood for it.

Yet in that time, Brand extolled the virtue of Männerbunds, the free yet militant associations of men and boy under a common enthusiasm and love for each others and the manly virtues of a high culture, often with a distinct military or militant aspect, in Greece's Sacred Theban band or Medieval Europe's knights and monks.

But scientists did not discover this just now to conveniently support the LGBTI lobby's agenda: the exact same behaviors have been observed for decades in chimpanzees as those we acknowledged readily (relatively speaking) with bonobos[^accepted], Jane Goodall herself explicitely refused to qualify them as homosexual or sexual at all, as she wrote herself, arguing that because there is no intromission (penetration), mountings and thrusts could not possibly be sexual. However, in Goodall’s 1971 book, In the Shadow of Man, she expressly distanced it from homosexuality[^Gooddall]. So... So foreplay in humans is never sexual either, no matter the cumming ?

As if intromission was necessary---or even customary---customary in homo intercourses[^sociosexual]. Nor is it always for hetero intercourses either. This systemic schizophrenia, is no better than denying the intrinsic erotic component of breastfeeding, leading to sexual arousal and climaxing.
Also let us not forget that many of these African sites' countries **criminalize homosexuality**, a fact that incontestably curtailed research[^african] lest for researchers go to prison and their funds removed. Worse, we should remember that chimpanzees are stil heavily hunted with not a lot of effort invested in their defense. There was the real risk for that small protection to go out the window if those countries were to see apes as perverts.

How could centers and reserve parks already constantly struggling with financial troubles and with wide-scale poaching from armed bands, hope to secure support from hostile corrupt low-IQ nigger governments if they started to low-key describe their apes as pederastic perverts ? **Of course they can't do that, no one in his right mind would, yet this is the accurate description.**

[Extensive summaries](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41559-019-1019-7 "An alternative hypothesis for the evolution of same-sex sexual behaviour in animals (2019)") of all species reported so far to feature homosexual relationships have been compiled, for those eager to verify our claims, and maybe put them to some use. While this last article does try to explain the very existence of such behaviors rather convincingly (basically, telling sexes apart would not necessarily be easy and it's often more efficient to amp up sex drive overall than improve female recognition skills), on the other hand it cannot explain why such behaviors evolved to be prevalent in highly intelligent species like chimpanzees, gorillas, us, and dolphins. We must precise though, that none of the above live in a carefree environment. Predators and dangers are plenty: jungle cats (leopards), python, other apes.

So it makes perfect sense that the extrasensory purpose of non-reproductive sexuality is either budding in apes, or well on its way... did someone study bonobos' potential psychic abilities ? Primitives in the Amazonian forest have been reported to possess a properly supernatural ability to spot on dangerous snakes **in the dark**. No one even imagined extrasensory perception could be a thing, and especially not an important feature in the strife for survival.
The cerebral requirements for visions or some degree of precognition may be little, in fact there is a good argument to make, for visionary functioning appearing before pure general computational intelligence: the intellect does depend require size, while the extrasensory might not, and *gives immediate solutions to situations*.

Theoretically speaking, we only need the hardware to see the pictures, and have some understanding of causality (which most animals do to some degree, including goddamn cocks), how to relate your perception to the problem at hand. As our intelligence and lifespan grew and our capacity to cancel predation, our reproductive needs dwindled to very little, and non-reproductive sexuality came to dominate completely.

Goebbels was wrong when he wrote <q>The mission of women is to be beautiful and to bring children into the world</q>, since **we descend from hardcore lesbian great apes**. Now we should ask ourselves, what could be the cost of a lifestyle so dramatically opposed to what simple observations reveal to be [our genetic programming ?](meta)

Even [lions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexual_behavior_in_animals#:~:text=Male%20lions%20pair%2Dbond%20for,to%20occur%20with%20other%20males), in some aspects decidely terribly antispiritual, violent, uncompassionate and uncaring killing machines, both in captivity and wild have been manifesting both male-on-male and female-on-female mountings[^homolions]. And to prove that the suppression of chimpanzees' homosexuality in the media is no conspiracy theory, Africans show the same degree of criminal retardation with lions. Easily explaining how the vast volume of anectodal observations from all honest field specialist and locals alike, have been systematically swept under the carpet instead of warranting dedicated studies.

Though for anatomical reasons it is rarer than in humans, sodomy is *not infrequent nor difficult* for many [apes and monkeys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-reproductive_sexual_behavior_in_animals#Anal_insertion "Non-reproductive sexual behavior in animals: Anal insertion"), in the homosexual as well as heterosexual context, with the finger and penis. At the very least we observed that it is not painful for either side, and given that no coercition was recorded, *it is most likely pleasurable too*. 

Penetration during mounting might occur on occasion with lions too, leading to... adverse reactions. But researchers could hardly verify *in situ*, no one volunteering to become **cat food** for science. And such spontaneous behavior just does lend itself to the controlled conditions of an *in-depth* anatomical inspection. And choosing to interpret something as a defensive reaction over a play behavior seems awfully subjective to me.

While self-aware intelligent animals like apes, some monkeys and cetaceans fit the bill very well for a budgeing or full-fledged metasexuality, explaining participating homosexuality, a fortiori sodomy considering the [morphological adaptations required](meta#a-case-for-sodomy), in lower species not known for their compassionate social behavior---male lions routinely **kill others' cubs**---or no social behavior at all such as [polecats](https://evolutionaryecology.fr.gd/The-polecat-project.htm "The European Polecat Project: Mustela putorius") seems harder to account for. **But facts are facts.**

[^Gooddall]:
	> Never, however, have we seen anything that could be regarded as homosexuality in chimpanzees… Admittedly, a male may mount another in times of stress or excitement, clasping the other around the waist, and he may even make thrusting movements of the pelvis, but there is no intromission. It is true, also, that a male may try to calm himself or another male by reaching out to touch or pat the other’s genitals; while we still have much to learn about this type of behavior, it certainly does not imply homosexuality. He only does this in moments of stress, and he will touch or pat a female on her genitals in exactly the same context.
[^accepted]:
	> The big question is, how did we manage to miss these behaviors in chimpanzees for so long? Chimpanzees are one of the most well-studied primates, due to our biases toward studying our closest relatives. Bonobos are equally related to us, but chimpanzees are better studied due to their wider geographic distribution, and higher numbers in captivity. The longest-running chimpanzee field sites have been running for over 50 years. The answer is that we have not missed it entirely, but simply overlooked it as part of a suite of other behaviors. It has been documented by many studies before, but often is reported as something other than “sociosexual behavior,” subsumed under behaviors such as “reassurance” or “reconciliation,” or “gestures”. This likely is related to cultural biases preventing consideration of these behaviors as related to sexuality, particularly the potential for homosexuality. Sandel and Reddy point out that Jane Goodall, as well as other primatologists, have observed such behaviors in chimpanzees.
[^sociosexual]:
	> When those behaviors in bonobos are classified as “sociosexual” whereas in chimpanzees they are classified as ‘’reassurance,” it prevents us from directly comparing and contrasting behaviors between the two sister species. Furthermore, it prevents us from considering ape sexuality, and the potential for homosexual apes, on its own terms.
[^african]:
	> There are also cultural factors that may hinder studying and reporting sociosexual behaviors. Ngogo is located in Uganda, where there has been a series of controversial laws that criminalized homosexuality, *with penalties for “promoting” or “failing to report” homosexuality*. There are several other countries with similar laws where chimpanzee field sites are located. This can potentially affect research in two ways: first, queer primatologists may not feel safe conducting fieldwork there. Second, researchers and field assistants might be more hesitant to characterize same-sex behaviors in a way that could imply homosexuality because of cultural and legal risks. [...](#)For example, more recent research on same-sex sexual behavior across animal species suggests we may have been [overemphasizing heterosexual behavior all along](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-019-1019-7).

	[Males:](#)
	The case in point was a pair of prime territorial males, aged 6 to 7 years. When not with females, they manifested their homosexual streak. The male lions from Khokhra in Gir holding about 70 km², though mated with three of the four females in the territory, were found engaging in homosexual activity. They were spotted by a group of trackers for five days in November 1999 and three days in December 1999 where the larger male mounted the smaller partner showing a subservient receptive attitude.
	The paper stated that </q>The smaller one rarely growled, unlike larger ones during mating. Each mounting lasted 12-23 seconds, and the gap between the two mountings varied from 4-12 minutes. The frequency increased during the morning and evening hours. Of the 45 mountings observed, the smaller male showed repulsive action in four cases, which may be due to the actual anal penetration during mounting</q>⋅ It also noted that in the areas where these lions moved had a low female population.

	[Females:](#)
	Chavan reported lesbianism in the Asiatic lionesses of Gir also in 1982. In The paper “Observation of Homosexual behaviour in Asiatic lion”, he states to have observed homosexual behaviour in two adult lionesses on three occasions in Gir Sanctuary. Both the lionesses were adults over 15 years of age.
	The paper notes an incident where a lioness was mounted by another in similar posturing as that of a male when she was unable to *obtain a favourable response from a male lion* who seemed tired and kept resting after third day of mating. The paper records *the females to have switched positions on repeated occasions*. The male was also close to them but *remained indifferent to the females*, the paper noted.

### A case for sodomy

#### Natural lubrication and cooking

The anatomical disparity between bonobos and humans  quite significant: the sexual dimorphy is lesser so compared to chimpanzees males are relatively smaller and females taller, while penises are smaller and clitoris huge, so much so that clitoral penetration has been observed !

Penile sodomy is impossible to them, and overall the most frequent contact is genital-genital rubbing (dry humping or tribadism for lesbians, while it lacks a name when it involves a penis). But male homosexuals are mostly unanimous as to what contact provides the stronger pleasure, by miles: passive sodomy.

In essence this issue is not limited to gays or male homos. Though bonobos do show a great deal of our erotic genetic norm, what we should aspire to and express if not for induced sexual repression (and endogenous inhibitions due to cooking), on the other hand it seems like we did improve on them, a lot.

We became much more atune to energy, much more capable to feel it, internalize and metabolize it: the evolution toward complexity of consciousness started with apes, continued within our own lineage, with some failures and successes along the way, in the form of the various phenotypes/species either continuously improving on themselves, mixing out, erased by others or failing to adapt to climate changes. Though we currently fill them with shit our big brains theoretically allow for an expanded consciousness richer in experience than anything a primate's could host.

The most obvious **anatomical** change associated with such a heightened metapsychical metabolism (beside brain size) that our theory can explain, is our much improved ability for **passive** sodomy.

People who unlocked it fully, be them men or women, can lubricate very quickly, better than most vaginas can boast of. This very fact is still ignored (or flat out rejected in a self-justification lashing-out) by <q>authorities</q> in the matter, even the most disgustingly liberal ones:
> Before I slide down this particular pole, let me reveal a bias: I am a firm believer that lube makes any sexual activity much more pleasurable. The wetter and slipperier everything is, the better. But lubricant is not just desirable; it's essential to any anal penetration. Unlike the vagina, the anus and rectum are not self-lubricating.
> During anal exploration of yourself or a partner, you might find that the anus feels wet. What you're feeling is a natural mucous secretion from the anal canal and maybe some sweat—but neither this nor spit provides enough wetness to do the trick. Beyond sneaking a finger a millimeter inside someone's ass, *you need lube*.

We find the same discourse from a rabid retarded Christian:
> Finally, the human sexual body itself reflects what is natural, the tradition taught. A penis can slide into a vagina easily and comfortably during love-making, while anal penetration requires artificial lubrication and often causes pain. 

Which is remarkably wrong on all accounts. **There exists a distinct anal lubrication**, which might even make adjunction of saliva unnecessary.
{.important #anal_lubrication}

Specialized glands exist called anal glands, whose original function is to ensure adequate lubrication during excretion at the end of the tube: [the glands of Hermann and Fossé](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anal_gland)[^dd]. They also produce odoriferous substances marking a male's territory. It also helps the natural inner cleaning of the anus and rectum.[^suppuration] Those same glands must have been repurposed since our separation from chimpanzees (at least some good 9 millions years ago) in order to support penile sodomy all the way. Under good psychological conditions an individual can excrete an ungodly amount of such lubricant  - enough to visibly grease buttocks - with little to no stimulation, reliably. 

The fact the majority of people (not even of homosexuals) can not boast of such a feat, is easy to account for, not contradicting the theory one bit. Vaginas lubricate better in most circumstances because of the following:
 1. Vagina are meant (mainly) for reproduction from the moment of the first periods, hence its lubrication is under control of the same chaotic breeding instincts amplified by dietary feedback. As there are reasons to believe in an excessive fertility on a physiological and hormonal level, women could logically lubricate too easily, when neither energy nor the need or desire to make a baby arise, as an automatic response to a situation evocative of breeding. In other words, in presence of a triggering pattern specific to the breeding instinctive program.
 1. This program, being more animalistic in nature, activates much more easily that's why it has to be actively (though spontaneously) restrained and corralled into more civilized and transcendent goals, **sublimated**, as Freud would have. Hence under extreme existential frustration and confusion of programs (akin to a BIOS corruption in a computer more than a simple OS bug), mating mechanisms would logically run amok[^amok].

On the other hand the three natural sources of lubricants necessary for a seemless sodomy totally depend on rather strict metasexual requirements, automatically ruling out it working in presence of feedback-induced endogenous stress or excitation.
{#why-sodomy-doesnt-work}

These *three sources* are:
 - Penises do produce a coat of lubricant (called Cowper's fluid or vulgarly precum), an excellent one, which nevertheless only answers to very important desires often of the metasexual kind such as age gap. For the same reason it can't be forced either, and often lack in intercourses.
 - Saliva is also an abundant source: but not just any saliva like the one involved in the early oral phase of digestion. *While it lacks an official recognition*, there is a distinct kind of fat viscous saliva excreted on command by the mouth's many glands (abundantly so).
 - **Anal lubrication proper**[^dd].
This biological ability, by far the most important for a pleasurable penetration, is also by far the most sensitive. Normally developped during [the anal stage before 6](https://www.britannica.com/science/anal-stage) through the mother's care (licking and fingering, as observed universally with Primitives), developing later in life is challending, even under raw conditions

All instincts need actualizing and it is theorized that the key moment for learning ensuring a normal healthy structuring regards to anal sensibility (later on proper sodomy) occurs early on between 0 and 4 (or 6) years old, when the mother should routinely caress and pleasure with her fingers and tongue our lovely butthole up to and including gentle penetrations, as the annals of ethnology relate, both for practical purpose and energy.

While being it should be as ordinary and intuitive as learning how to walk or talk, it appears extraordinary only because it's lacking in our model of education. And as for walking or talking, learning how to love requires the active involvement of adults, of **a functional society** let a dire deficiency to take place and be extremely difficult - though not impossible - overcome afterward.

For someone who did not grow his sensibility in due time nor endeavoured to compensate afterward with conscious efforts, any attempt at penetration, even with fingers, will be met with *the anus clamping extremely strongly*, beside the absence of lubrification, leading most gays (let alone heterosexuals) to resort to lube.

This mere biological incompability (at least statistically) between sophisticated cooking and even the physical components of metasexuality, is the main reason behind the rarity of natural sodomy today, **even for people who actually enjoy it**.

One the other hand, with enough training and exposition to the correct sexual situations as well as the proper attitude, even very late (as Guy‑Claude Burger could attest) it works well.

#### The smell argument

The **<q>bad smell</q> or <q>unclean</q>** argument against sodomy has a bit more truth to it, but doesn't really stand up to close scrutiny either. Bad smells from feces do not exist in nature: wild animals' stools do not smell at all and those of instincto babies neither. Healthy rectums are self-cleaning. Those odors come from systematically bad digestive processes, which otherwise would be as transparent as any organ in the body we are not supposed to think about nor can control consciously.

Elimination of denatured molecules in instincto and/or consecutively to viral episodes, also induces the expulsion of such <q>fragrant bouquets</q>: what goes in by error, goes out by design, or we wouldn't live nearly as long as we do... It also means different persons will stink more or less depending on their diet and overall health. Different cultures or the same at different points in time will vary for the same reasons, as per all pathological processes.

Nevertheless **<q>accidents</q> of a coprologic nature** even without raw food are actually as uncommon as easy to avoid, pointing at **bad smell and faeces rather acting as both a symbols** for that disgust of anality and **a convenient excuse, masking for our peace of mind the true unconscious irrational motives**.
Beside, many vaginas also famously smell bad, proportionally to their owner's bad diet. Yet this doesn't discourage heterosexual men from shoving their dick in them.

We believe that increasingly complex cooking induced a world-wide tendency not only to reject sodomy on a conscious level, but more importantly it radically hinders or stop altogether, the natural tendency to lick infants to clean them, like do all mammals.

#### Harder is not better

The selective pressure of metasexual energy processing might possibly explain the loss of our [**baculum**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baculum), which is a bone present in the penis making it rigid at all time... yes, always hard. Most mammals have it, others don't, and while all primates have it, men lost all of it. We don't understand these fast and extremely frequent changes (*Evidence suggests that the baculum was independently evolved 9 times and lost in 10 separate lineages*) as evidenced by the nonsensical opinions:
> A bone in the penis allows a male to mate for a long time with a female, which can be a distinct advantage in some mating strategies. The length of the baculum may be related to the duration of copulation in some species

Except that... individual human copulations figure among the longest in the animal kingdom hands down. More likely usually chance genetic drift have a lot to do with this. But *In humans, the rigidity of the erection is provided entirely through blood pressure in the corpora cavernosa* and I don't think anyone has to complain... In any case our inborn expectations for performance would necessarily match our capabilities.

But on the other hand, being steel-hard is useless. On the contrary penile flexible softness adds a great deal to the variety of sensation, and adapt our sacro-sainct glorious penis to a wealth of locations and touchings, whose exquisiteness might actually exceed bonobos'. Hands, butts, mouth, armpits, from any direction, you name it. Only true humans could take from a chaotic child game in apes to a true symphony of magical accords.

Now about the most important part, the enjoymnent: 
```quote{cite="[137 Women Explain What An Anal Orgasm Feels Like & How To Have One](https://badgirlsbible.com/anal-orgasms)"}
The anus is packed with nerves, especially the incredibly erogenous pudendal nerve—which connects to the clitoris. The pudendal nerve carries sensation to and from your perineum, reaching your vagina, vulva, and anus, too.

Some women describe it as being similar to a clitoral orgasm—a pulse of pleasurable contractions, but this time around the anal sphincter. Others may feel more of a <q>spreading wave</q> of pleasure.

I surveyed 2,110 women, of all orientations, on whether they’ve had an anal orgasm or not. 28.4% of women have had at least one anal orgasm, which means they are certainly possible, but most women have not yet had one.

> It was an intense sensation like a clitoral orgasm but like ten times more intense. ya know like Mount Saint Helen just blew a wad. He was pounding me deep, hard, and fast and as he got more excited, I got more excited and we came at the same time.

> The feeling lasted longer than clitoral/vaginal orgasms. I kept moaning even after he was out of me. It was amazing, it is more powerful than a vaginal orgasm. The anal area is so much more sensitive than the vagina it feels like. So the sensation was on many levels a very titillating experience. Different in an up my spine sensation.

> It was combined with clitoral but was way more intense than vaginal combined with clitoral. Could come more easily than with vaginal.
```

While the descriptions vary and may sound rather exaggerated or outright fabricated, from my own experience I know it is - **can** be - at least extremely pleasant for women while for men it is the strongest physical experience, usually way above isolated front orgasm in comparison coming up short in relief, power and *duration*, **by miles**. This, is something 95% of heterosexual men fully ignore, a fact which statistically necesarily bears the most far-reaching consequences. According to Ancient Greeks, passivity (synonymous with [pedication](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pedication#Noun)) not only wasn't infamous, but it was thought that **boys loved by elders make for the most virile warriors and statesmen**.

Anality rose as the primary and most advanced exchange of energy, and the intensity, ease of access and wealth of sensation it brings match its metapsychical importance.

## Theoretical bases of the Neolithic Mind

### Cross-drive Induction
 
Since cooking and later the Neolithic Revolution with the advent of *agriculture* cerebral disturbances have increased steadily, warping our very psychic functioning further and further from the mental and emotional balance, the state of inner harmony everyone should be capable of, and that characterized wild animals in absence of stress. On the opposite feedback induces the neurologic tendency to repeat mental patterns from ideas to behaviors, by feeding cerebral centers the product of their own processing, drifting further and further from the original signal, be it a physical stimulus or the first impression. *Like a micro and speaker in the Larsen effect*. Thus, this automatism mental, we call feedback, as if the brain actively feeds on its own noise.

All mental issues ranging from slight imperfections to typical cases in madhouses (with the exceptions of known genetic or otherwise biological aberrations or developmental troubles) fall naturally into one or more of the three categories of *neurosis*, *schizoid dissociation* and *paranoïa* (synonymous with psychosis).

```quote{author="Guy-Claude Burger"}
The correction of food hygiene, in the sense of a diet closer to the genetic data of the metabolism, favors the relaxation of the central nervous system, the release of censorship, fixations, and internal tensions in general. As we will see later, the use of natural raw foods can also have an impact on paranoid tendencies and facilitate the abandonment of cleavages and stereotypes, thus facilitating a restructuring.
```

The definition of the natural raw norm created a powerful theoretical framework with the unintended consequence of describing all behaviors by the same few categories, akin to physics' field equations or Theory Of Everything. Once the essence of reality has been understood, accurate models then flow flawlessly without the need for ad-hoc corrections years after years.

In our case, it appeared that all behaviors pathological or not and their deviation toward the natural state (the acceptance of reality - interior and exterior - and knowing precisely where mental projections and the world meet or separate) are modelized by three parameters and one absolutely revolutionary overarching heuristics, making sense of everything else.

The defining characteristic of meta­psychoanalysis is not merely the refinement of old psychoanalytic concepts nor the traumatizing realization nearly all humanity is rendered insane on a molecular level.

What could truly unwind the essence of human behaviors across the millenia, is *the discovery of two separate instinctive programs* regulating romantic and sexual appeals, *one* pertaining to *spiritually fecund relationships* (by far the dominant one since the bonobo) *the other aimed at reproduction*.

The purpose of primitive animals is to reproduce while a handful of mammals evolved intimacy as a means to enhance consciousness ([as Plato elucidated](homofascism#Plato)) through the exchange of metasexual energy, ultimately ensuring the indefinite existence of the species in the future.

Paradigms of the [cross-drive induction theory](DFN):
* As the metapsychic program evolved on an animal basis, nearly all instincts and associated fantasies in one program have a direct analogue in the other.
* Since the Neolithic fulfilling our subtle metasexual and metapsychic needs is impossible because of the state of feedback the flooding of denatured molecules causes, exaggerating our basest, most animalistic urges, centered on breeding.
* But because the metasexual drive can not disappear, we observe instead the systematic transfer of investment from metasexual partial drives to their reproductional equivalents the closest in form and mental fantasies.

### Vagina obsession

In [our research on pederasty](homofascism), which includes both girls and boys, we state the irrepleacable value of **sodomy**. It does stem from any kind of wierd obsession, but from a desire to fix which is *by far the most neglected side of our potential*. Monkeys feature a more expansive sexual repertoire. The place of vaginal penetration would probably make for at most 30% of heterosexual contacts, which would in and of themselves, be the minor part. We believe the place of vaginal penetration would probably make for at most 30% of heterosexual contacts (with most of them *double penetrations*), while heterosexuality in general would dwindle, if we are to believe apes. But the root of all danger in sex is not heterosexuality per se... But **vaginas**.

Vaginas hold a special almost metaphysical sway on men, bewitching them due to the unholy conjunction of cooking's base instincts hyperexcitability and metasexual frustration[^gland]. This inherent risk with any involvement with females (from the perspective of males, since let's be real, cultures always center around them) show very strongly in all chivalrous cultures, in history and mythology. The idea to adore the female archetype as a beacon of hope but without letting desire consume you. There is the prevailing idea of a willing <q>sacrifice</q>r in the worship of the lady.

Alphaville tells it very well:
```quote {author="Alphaville" cite="Fallen Angel" .col_2}
I said: I want you, Baby,
I said: I want some more
*I said: I never ever felt it like that moment before
She's an assassin,*
She's melting steel in my heart
But I long for more.

She said: I want your body,
She said: *I want your soul*
She said: A fallen angel takes it but she'll never let go
*She's an invader*
She's from another world
But I beg for more and more

She's raising feelings cutting like a knife
She's pouring fire into my liquid life
There's no escaping from her mysteries,
*She gives me kisses of the strangest kind*
She says: I know you'll like it,
So come over here
She says: *Just let that rhythm filter*
Through your body, dear
and then she...
She always did it and she always will
*She'll stay that hunter*
'till the end of time
```

We perceive female sexuality on a coital level as intrinsically dangerous and ravenous, feeding off virile energy and *emasculating us*. No better illustration exists than the world-wide primeval myth of the [vagina dentata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagina_dentata).

Each sex has its own set of unconscious inborn basic narrative or picturesque patterns, from which we generate either unconscious content or artistic and cultural productions of all kinds (up to foundational myths at the core of all societies) featuring our strongest fears in order to protect us from the risk of spiritual destruction that an unnatural sexuality carries, and let's be honest, carried out already (seeing the state humanity arrived in).

This inborn mental function called **mythogenesis**[^mythogenesis] evolved to protect our most important assets (our spiritual, metapsychic integrity). It is on throttle since the start of cooking as evidenced by the strikingly profuse amount of the Paleolithic Venuses, figures we found scattered over all of Europe up to Asia Minor (Anatolia, current Turkey). Because this is the number one issue (save for cooking), women, vaginas and all the evils they unknowingly and for the most part, unvoluntarily unleashed on the world, are the epicenter of all myth-making activities everywhere in the **world**.

All myths and religions ought to either justify or solve---usually a bit of both---the constant metapsychic threat of *breeding-oriented sexuality*.
{.danger}

Therein lies the problem: we have nothing against vaginas nor coitus per se. In many situations, which should be the dominant forms of heterosexuality ([incest](incest) and [pedophilia](.#pedophilia)), it is beyond blame. It is just a shame, that with cooking, our hormonal wiring goes haywire and an eternal temptation settles, threatening our metapsychic integrity. With an uprising (and junk food) such as that of most civilized country, it becomes an absolutely irrepressible obsession, and the perdition of 90% of the population.

The content of actual fantasies most often take after mixed traits, not entirely pure nor impure, between good (the *meta*sexual) and evil (the <q>bestial</q>). If caricatural machistic (or the simpering, beta-male kind for the matter) heterosexuality exemplify true degeneracy, one could consider on the other hand that sodomizing girls acts as a natural counter-balancing drive, the polar opposite of degraded heterosexuality, thus helping in freeing up the libido invested in the breeding instinctive program.

> The Immaculate Conception rejects the idea of a divine child born out of copulation. Dracula feeds on the blood of his partners. For a century, the strongest of cinema has revolved around the same problem. May 68 advocated making love, not war...
{.aside}

So we see that the model of the jealous couple was a byproduct of the breeding instinctive program, hence dominant - while not successful ! - in lower species but inoperant in higher species on their way to domesticate sexuality in service of metapsychic evolution. Many cultures, such as Catholic Europe and Ancient Greece and Rome, used to draw a strong line between marital duties in the community-sanctioned marriage (aimed respectively at maintaining the community or provide citizens/soldiers for the State), and love, sexuality, pleasure.

People used to *compartmentalize*, being unable to stop their depravation simply put it in a different mental and social category , to save their higher aspirations as much as possible, placing the same women they would inevitably high above them. Normally the women we fuck are kept separate, in time or persons. For instance, Italians worship their mother and daughters and would not let another man approach them, oblivious to the fact they themselves had to take away someone's daughter or sister[^freud]. 

This dichotomy made of wilful ignorance and obligate splitting allows people to continue on living in society, only [letting go](/Images/meta/FIGHTclub_edit_let_go.mp4) of this self-imposed stabilizing pressure in specific situations, ideally wars away from home or in the worst case scenario, revolutions and civil wars with it s load of insane wholesale massacres, families reaching for each other's throat[^African]. How to explain such a happening if not by the gushing out of a hitherto dormant mass of uncontrollable savage resentment, then amplified by feedback-induced madness ?

The solution is simply for energetic relationships to dominate.
{.important}

This constant flow of energy would then feed the occasional births, as *announciated in visions, prophetic dreams*. In nature, breeding instincts woudl simply stay under control of the metasexual/metapsychic program, and we wouldn't breed more than a few times per life (to maintain sane population levels) without a need for intellectual birth control. So clearly this notion can not be used to indulge in regular mock breeding, with the pretext that <q>as long as I am gay enough I am beyond reproach</q>.

For a woman without health issue who puts her mind to it, getting pregnant is too easy. So even if one truly had to make as much babies as humanly possible, which all Nordic people should---by law--the days justifyingly dedicated to intercourses wouldn't exceed a few per month.

Moreover, it is all the more necessary to stay pure energetically if one is called to procreate: This is the correct interpretation of the Immaculate Conception myth: breeding is a natural function, a very important one at that, and shouldn't contradict higher aspirations, one reason being the later (the metapsychic plane of love) having evolved much later, from the framework of reproductional sexuality, hence can only take into account. As a matter of fact Isis was goddess of *magic, virginity, sexuality and motherhood*.

Incidentally Isis was married to her **brother**, reputed to bring about agriculture of *cereals* and was cut in many pieces by his brother Seth, the personification of a *chaotic yet spiritually sterile sexuality*. An allusion to [schizoid dissociative tendencies](.#splitting), whose association with cereals (wheat in particular) is [well-known](.#cereals). Their association to a disturbed sexuality however, is less known, [except by us](instincto#sex). In contrast, Isis and her twin Nephtys, both loved Osiris their brother so much that they magically pieced together his whole and resurrects him as well as magically give birth to a child. This created the *After-life, an eternal existence beyond life and death for everyone*.

Lastly, the experience in Montramé established points toward the existence, in a raw context, of a reliable *natural anticonceptional mechanism* innate to females' body, under nervous or/and hormonal control of the unconscious, an ability known by science for many species but not until now in humans. Even in near total absence of consideration for pregnancies and protection or pills *unexpected pregnancy were notably sparse if existing at all*, unlike the avalanche one could expect despite the *absurd amount of chaotic fucking* taking place.

A slighty impure unconscious (or very conscious) attitude from either partner will infect the girl unconsciously, initiating a pregnancy: sadly an almost automatic occurence in society given the [biological innate susceptibility of women to the instinctive reproductive complex](homofascism#female_breeding_weakness).

#### The root of jealousy

Both <q>science</q> and common wisdom concur that *monogamy* is the natural form of matings with the justification that fidelity and repetition solidify the home, create a stable environment for the offspring and take advantage of the largest window of fertility before one or the other partner has his or her menopause or the equivalent to make as many children as possible. Love is basically nature luring you with the pleasure of sex, to trick you in the hassle and *enormous* personal investment of procreation.

But that concept is widely contradicted by the animal world: closing the horizon of partners is illogical and lo and behold, in the majority of monogamous species, *adultery is the norm*. Settling on one partner precludes seeking the best genes in the interest of the offspring. While most inferior species, concerned only with basic reproduction, do not form lasting bonds between genitors beyond the short time it takes for younglings to reach maturity.

In many primitive cultures the notion of faithful couples and sexual exclusivity do not exist. Their social norms (and good diet, at least in some aspects) manage to reduce jealousy, to the point that in some cases young girls are taught to *ride a high number of partners* (according to Malinowksi, <q>bathing in semen</q>). Exclusivity is the deat of passion, love and desire. History is full of men mistreating unfaithful women horribly while they gave themselves the right to fuck any random hoe. To the extreme, men' over-reaction is [beyond unimaginable in cruelty, including from the falsely called <q>Natives</q>](https://www.quora.com/What-facts-could-destroy-our-romantic-notions-regarding-indigenous-people).

There are two major causes for jealousy. At puberty heterosexuality becomes definitive for 90% of the population and takes on its <q>procreative</q> orientation... because a non-procreative heterosexuality is totally possible, as we will see. The metasexual program does not include this kind of strict sexual polarity: in particular the representation of coitus only kicks in at puberty. A sexuality centered on energy would be as if blind to gender and age differences. Simply put, orgasms and **butts** have no gender.

In nature, the infant would bath in energy from both the father and the mother, or at least people of both sex their parents or not. Instead the baby is frustrated from day one, and whenever his mind matured enough to separate himself from his mother, he also begets the category of <q>the Other</q>, the archetypal <q>third person</q>.

But a hypothetical situation where the father would willingly leave the child alone to sleep with the mother there wouldn't be much of a solution either: it's more complicated. An absentee father is better than a castrating or violent one, but in the end but does not provide **energy** either.

And since touching children - even our own - in any way that could provide them some erotic gratification has been progressively outlawed and vilified to the extreme, the possibility for them to feel what they should or do in nature, has become utterly impossible.

Due to this lack of real love, the unbelievable trauma of a sexless childhood leave every single person a permanent scare, whether we want it or not, just like malnutrition causes permanent growth issues that never fully heal afterwards.

Most of us become soulless golems, easy to manipulate and order around by an equally soulless but more malignant elite.
{.danger}

Freud had at first ascribed the castration complex (feeling of inferiority and groundless anxiety linked to sex) under the (admittedly detestable) practice of threatening boys with *cutting their dick off* to make them obey. Then realized the complex (sex-related feeling of anxiety or guilt) was just as present when parents did not employ these methods.

Typically, as the mother is too absorbed in her suffering within her marital relationship, she has nothing to give and quickly enough the baby resents the father as the responsible, often rightfully so. Freud described the jealousy of fathers toward their infant children, monopolizing the mother and so hindering men' access to sex. Because we are talking of babies or infants that do not think rationally, *as a consequence all third parties are categorized as enemies or thieves*.

Hence we quickly learn it is impossible to love several people at the same time. We learn to think in exclusionary, binary terms. Only ever one person at a time. A winner implies a looser. A way of thinking christened as the <q>2-1</q> mode, while opening up to opening to more people coincides with **more** happiness, not less.

*Then arrives the chemical factor which we illustrated with the Hottentot Venus.* In general, feedback overstimulates the grossest, oldest impulse centers of the brain, which in love corresponds to reproduction, of which jealousy is a part, as the obvious drive to chase away male concurrents to maximize one's offspring.

```quote{cite="The Iron Dream" author="Spinrad" .important .aside}
Further, there were a dozen or more naked females shrieking and moaning; these were not true humans but pleasure sluts of the sort the Dominators bred for themselves in Zind—**mindless creatures with oversized hips and breasts motivated solely by a boundless need for copulation**.
```

What we call <q>desire</q>, is today society most of the time wholly disconnected from love. Purely physical, this kind of drive is indeed unnatural, and is part of the IRP (instinctive reproductive program), but in a deregulated way. The phase all boys go through, during which they have to fight with their desire to penetrate anything that reminds them of the <q>three points</q> (two breasts, one vagina) kinda exists in nature but it happens here *on steroids*.

Women also have vaginal and reproductive urges that they invest similarly from puberty, but the hormonal difference very often makes our male urges more <q>aggressive</q>, *self-assertive*. And if the men are not satisfied, they can find some little crude pleasure while in terms of <q>sensitivity</q> the woman's glans is on her clitoris, so orgasm for her is the rarest exception instead of the rule. **90% of women simulate, the rest being lesbians, or taking care of themselves.**

Hormonal imbalances cause this kind of deregulation and the [adolescence spurt](instincto#puberty), but it only takes on an *irresistible aspect* in response to all the pent-up frustration the boy has kept inside him for years as a child, *because of the prohibition of adult-children relationships*, and the ever limited capacity for adults to respond to this love in the proper way, because of feedback. Simply put, even when our repressive laws didn't exist, people still weren't pedophiles in their majority.

The [role of hormones](DFN) in adolescent excitation
: It is often said that <q>hormones</q> takes over adolescents. This is both right and wrong. It is right that the immediate and proximal cause is *chemical* as mentioned below, and changing diet does reduce excitation a lot.  But it could not be enough to curtail homosexuality totally if not for the Oedipus complex, the crystalisation of the otherwise natural desire for the mother but pent-up and frustrated by years of continence as a child, when having sex should actually be of the utmost importance.
  Hence the superlative hormonal change of a pathological kind of puberty compounded by years of frustration triggers the often degenerative, mindless thirst for sex in adolescents.
{.aside #oedipus}

Because of the total absence of early initiation plus our whole culture telling blatant lies about the joys of marriage and/or **normative** heterosexuality - and boys, not realizing what happens, can't help but pour all their transcendental hopes into the new program initiating.

The **frustrated libido then invests entirely in the path of breeding**, automatically seeking males to provide for her and her future babies, which girls just can't stop thinking about.
{.important}

And as logical companion to this unconscious shift toward the *breeding program*, jealousy settles as so deeply rooted a part of our daily thinking most people can not fathom living without, no more than without language or cloths.  At the same time, the qualities linked to matter and organization will take on an inordinate importance, to the detriment of genius and intuition linked to the metapsychic, to the spiritual world. This is the heart of the *cross-drive analysis*, the most far-reaching piece of the theory.

```quote {author="Joy Division" cite="[Love will tear us apart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=674KGKRQBPE)" .important .aside}
Why is the bedroom so cold? You've turned away on your side
Is my timing that flawed? Our respect runs so dry
Yet there's still this appeal that we've kept through our lives
```

Concurrently, this Oedipus complex locks people in couples or the <q>2-1</q> model by amping up the *<q>natural</q> posessiveness* with a deap-seated fear of loosing our partner... and thus, the projected substitute for the parent (of usually the opposite sex) we invested all our hopes in during childhood). If we could actually make love to our parents, we would not see such a regressive, immature relationship to the opposite sex. Without that initiation, we are doomed.

Next, in terms of evolutionary psychology, experience show that across the whole animal kingdom the best offpsring are obtained by a female by copulating in rapid succession, if not at the exact same time, by as much partners as practically possible, each sperm *ferociously competiting* for the ovule. Studies prove that the female body has [an insane power of discrimination, within each ejaculate as well as between them](eugenics#discrimination).

Ergo, even if demented religious fundamentalists along with athetists were right and that the purpose of life is to reproduce, enforcing monogamy and making cheating immoral or illegal would *suppress sexual competition* and thus *undermine evolution* ! Because sperm competition is a crucial aspect of instinctive eugenics, Outlawing or making immoral polygamy and prosmiscuity is actually the worst policy imaginable for our genes.

* The male's interest is to impregnate a wide number of females and keep them for himself, especially if he has to care for the children.
* The female's interest is to maximize her chance and mate with the best males (**_plural_**) to give the best genetics for her children, **and** convince **one** male to care for her and her children.

Politically, the logical outcome of masculine and feminine debase breeding instincts are these:
- What male conservatists (machists in general) do is to create a society in the interest of *males and males only*, buying social peace by ensuring every man gets **his** females (plural, if possible) to breed and penetrate away from other men' sight.
**The Shariah laws.**
Because reproductively males (or Negroes) are only interested in a female's womb and it is **unique**, so to please everyone a perverted patriarchy will assign females as to individual males, and *protect them from all others*.
- What feminists wish all men to be shared in common to women, who can use them as inoffensive, spineless sexual **playthings** as they please. We get a world identical to the one the movie *Barbie* pictures, or the one in [*Lysistrata Or Woman's Future and Future Woman*](https://www.anthonymludovici.com/lys_int.htm) by Ludovici.
And because what females need is men' sperm, which is virtually unlimited, a matriarchal society will nearly always praise unlimited promiscuity, while castrating men politically one way or the other... mostly by appealing to their thirst for sex, changing all men into the male feminist *beta ally* type pandering to women, exchanging their dignity for the right to have sex.

Even disregarding the female power fantasy, the blind promiscuity Barbie portrayed is evolutionarily **terrible**: we should not provide for the children of people we don't like or respect.
{.important}

In evolved animal societies, males try to confiscate female reproduction (emphasis on <q>try</q>: *female* adultery is universal), keeping it for themselves and a few other males they like and usually to which they *are related* (wolves packs, tiger ambushes and lion prides), to the point of [killing cubs](homofascism#cub_killing) of an unknown father.

But more intelligent social animals (primates and cetaceans in particular) identify not to a small family, but to the group within which they live.
Chimpanzees and bonobos differ but everyone being given its chance to woo females and reproduce, and more often than not groups' members are very related genetically, *if not properly consanguineous*. Hence, our instincts evolved to consider group interests has become more important than the individual's. Altruism and <q>fair play</q> make sense genetically in tightly-knit small groups.

{.aside .danger}

Especially when fathers individually don't dedicate much resource on children.
From an evolutionary perspective, from males' perspective sex and babies are good but if females can give no assurance of their discernment, *we have no reason to provide for them*.
Even when it comes to breeding only, we should practice promiscuity between brothers and sisters of sound instinct and genetics, who can trust each other with the responsability of perpetuating the ever superior species, not unlike what chimpanzee and bonobos do implicitely.

Hypergamists on the other hand, can not be trusted anything, especially not the interest of the species. They lack any discernment and will happily hump negroes and objective subhumans, for superficial aesthetic reasons, or to feel superior. As such a matriarchal community is almost always a group of women (or men) jacking off collectively at the sound of how great they are, only seeing society only as a means to stroke their own ego or sex, with no one willing to sacrifice anything for anyone else, or make any effort.

Bottom line is, the feminist Barbie supremacist power fantasy is still at the end of the day an unconscious *breeding fantasy, the female equivalent of Sharia law*, and just like it caused by cooking on one hand and resentment from years of normative sexuality on the other.

### Neurosis

This denotes the ability to put a desire or wish on hold and invest the emotional energy (<q>libido</q>) elsewhere. It is essential for animals to learn to delay the satisfaction or expression of instincts until the context is right, depending on the environment, physical or social. All animals can do it to some degree, while obviously the bigger the brain the higher the capacity for *metacognition and rationalization* and thus, for investing that resources, psychic or physical, toward not the specific outcome desired, but the proximate steps toward a later but ultimately more desirable fulfillment of some kind for that instinct. We do not blindly give in to impulses and the urge for immediate gratification, to favor a better future as our intellect predicts. *No more <q>muh diik nigga</q>*.

This natural attribute becomes neurosis and pathological, when the *unconsciously internalized* result of a *repressive parental upbringing* (or similar conditionings) *takes the place of _conscious_ rational motives*, *deviating or perverting that drive* toward socially desirable outcomes leaving said desires unfulfilled and the individual unknowingly frustrated.

But since typically sexual desires are all aimed at energy and metapsychic ends, they are not offset easily and frustration pents up, ordering all that nervous energy to go somewhere, twisting the personality in increasingly worse ways as years go by. Broadly speaking, unconscious neurosis (almost a tautology) is to current people's mind, what the conscious rational and *conditional* postponing of behaviors waiting for a favorable context, was to the natural mind. **Feedback** doesn't play a big role here, but crank up the next component (paranoia) up to eleven, which then amplifies the frustration and compulsions resulting from neurosis.

### Paranoia

Paranoia, is the tendency to <q>believe in oneself</q>, regardless of evidence, experiences and rational conclusions. It is also the <q>*ego*</q> of Eastern philosophies while the psychoanalytic notion of <q>Ich</q>, <q>Moi</q> or <q>I</q> (often translated in the Latin <q>Ego</q>) rather equals the <q>Self</q>, the neutral sense of identity.
This understanding of paranoia is specific to Burger's metapsychoanalysis, and reflects the long experience of comparing - often in the same person - the natural state and one under **feedback**. Paranoia is the belief in one's self-righteousness and refusal to *acknowledge sensory reality*.

Per se, it is not <q>unnatural</q>, but positively needed as in any context we never possess the full information needed to reach logical *certainty* for anything. For any question and endeavor, an amount of choice and belief or convincing is present. The very nature of the material world, makes some level of ego indispensable, even animals need to try at things (hunting preys, courting mates, challenging males) with a modicum of hope that it might succeed, especially when the risks involved or resources invested are significant. A <q>purely logical</q> assessment or choice which would always be  correct, would require total information, which is never available. And this assumes the universe *is* deterministic, but quantum physics hints at *probabilistic* universe, with unlikely occurrences of disproportionate effects (<q>Black Swans</q>) never ruled out. But when and where they happen, is inherently imprevisible through measurement.

The existence of *extra*-sensory perception does not allow for an categorically deterministic universe either, as spiritual informations always carry emotions and symbols, in our experience they rather broaden the range of possible outcomes, not limit them to <q>the one written to happen</q>.In fact, once can argue the extrasensory should fuel to the ego: a healthy *ego should derive its self-confidence from divine inspiration*, not from whatever inflated sense of prideful infallibility.

*Trust in destiny against all odds* should be to a healthy spirit what ego, what paranoia or *narcissism* (all the same) are to most.

Ego can be labeled as pathological whenever it outgrows any useful purpose despite clear evidence that our initial bet or stance fails to deliver and we should rather change our mind. Just like men cannot imagine their penis is not the end-all-be-all, sole purveyor of bliss for the woman.

It is more or less with the term <q>psychosis</q>, traditionally explained as the projection of one's inner content or desire into reality. Still traditionally, one CAN be made aware of a neurosis and the internal complex leading to a dysfunctional behavior, *while a psychotic can not*, as the inner source of his disorder is not accessible to his conscious.
To be precise, one could convince intellectually a psychotic that one's explanation is logical and *the cause does not lie outside* - someone being a reincarnation of Napoleon the First) but *inside* - the belief and desire of being Napoleon. But the psychotic will *still* have the very same impression, perceiving this reality as surely as he perceives his own mind.
It is said that curing psychosis is not possible, but we observed differently: paranoia tends to dwindle and we becomes able to see the world how it really appears (and maybe make a *conscious choice* to do otherwise, a healthy bet on an hypothetical but not impossible outcome). We become capable to see certitudes not as unconditional exterior facts, but simply as *beliefs*, inner content we give more or less credit.

We ascribe the egotic structuring of the self - primary narcissism and all paranoid, obsessive tendencies - to the early exposition of cooked food:

```quote
The alimentary origin of a primary paranoia, attributable to a defective learning of the alliesthetic variations of the gustatory pleasure in the culinary context and hypothecating the oedipal period through the overinvestment of the precocious impulses.
```

The idea is simple: raw food constantly changes from time to time, from terrible or downright painful, to bland or heavenly. Strawberries do not taste like strawberries, we discover a whole range of interesting variations, a true tapestry or symphony of tastes. Learning this reality very early (as a baby) when we barely start dissociating oneself from the outside world, has the effect of cementing an open minded attitude which sees expectations or hopes as anything but certain, while simply heeding one's senses of tastes and smell registers as the surest way to get pleasure, bliss, happiness. We learn to trust reality and mold our desires onto it, not to expect it to match our desires and *lashing out when they inevitably don't*.

On the other hand *starting life with cooked food, whose taste is linear* and always the same for a given food, does not lend itself to open mindedness, rather the opposite, to a assumption of *control*: *we learn that things are what we expect them to be*, and our happiness or sense of identity relies on our ability to predict them. We develop an obsession with *knowing* and controlling outcomes, and enter a state of wilful *denial* when it fails, refusing to accept facts.

This was for cooking's role in the early psychic structure. But it also amps up the innate brain tendency to confuse one's intellectual (or emotional) projections with reality itself, giving them an undue level of certitude and potency:
This ties to the very definition of the [feedback phenomena](DFN), which sees the brain feeding of its own output in a retroactive feedback look, and said projections getting way out of hand, out of sync with sensory (or extrasensory) inputs.

In practice, this makes <q>regular</q> people eating traditional obnoxious and cocky, exceedingly difficult to tell apart delusions and extricate emotional attachment <q>from facts</q>. Up to a certain point, one can still exert metacognition to see the truth but past it, we enter the psychiatric area. This point, still, varies from case to case and person to person, each society labeling <q>crazy</q> a different spectrum of personalities. Conversely, different kinds of crazy obsessions are deemed <q>normal</q> (meaning, not perceived at all !), part of <q>consensus reality</q>.

Neurosis and paranoia do not contradict or exclude each other, as we said, they all stem from essential mind properties. So in any given case, both are bound to figure in some shape or form, to varying degrees, according to what model seems most fitting, how strongly invested the delusion is and how much capacity for metacognition the person keeps.

### Schizoid tendencies

The third parameter is perhaps the most difficult to understand, unless one has had personal experience with it, as it is the least accessible to consciousness, actually touching the very consciousness itself in its physical/cerebral aspect, not its content.
{#splitting}

Splitting is a term used in psychiatry to describe the inability to hold or consider equally contradictory feelings or beliefs. It is the mind's tendency to lose unity and fragment: to forget or not keep track of what it does or thought, a phenomenon which ends up in the classic case of <q>multiple personalities</q>. However usually schizoid tendencies don't go nearly that far, more broadly it carries the meaning of bearing contradictory thoughts or reasonings at the same time, without being aware or making sense of it, as if separate minds were vying for attention beyond our control, causing an increasing state of [**groundless anxiety**](DFN "State of persistent fear or anxiety, devoid of identifiable object or motive, be it physical emotional or mental, and thus, inaccessible to analysis.") often causing a spiral of further fragmentation or compartimentalization as a defense mechanism, relegating the painful feelings to the background, or to separate persona in order to alleviate consciousness in other moments.

It has been proved to associate time and time again, with cereals, gluten in particular, hence with *wheat* in particular:
{#wheat}

```quote{cite="[Wheat Gluten as a Pathogenic Factor in Schizophrenia (1976)](www.doi.org/10.1126/science.1246624)"}
The likelihood that wheat gluten is a true pathogenic factor is further suggested by reports on the psychiatric characteristics of celiac patients who are known to be intolerant to wheat gluten and its analogs (15). These patients have been characterized as being turned inward, difficult in temperament, negativistic, *schizoid, paranoid, rigid and stereotyped*, and repetitious in behavior.
More importantly, it has been noted that these personality features tend to differentiate the celiacs from patients with other disorders associated with malabsorption and malnutrition, such as cystic fibrosis and ulcerative colitis.
A recent ethological study has shown that celiacs resemble psychotic patients in showing increased "flight" and decreased "play" behavior (16); these behaviors diminished when gluten was eliminated from their diet.
**In susceptible individuals, therefore, wheat gluten per se seems able to produce schizoid changes in personality.**
``` 
	
*Momentarily* being of <q>multiple minds</q>, withholding judgment but holding all in consideration like a Bose-Einstein condensate in quantum superposition unwilling to settle on one particular state, is - like for neurosis and paranoia - not problematic per se. As psychiatric terms, in some way paranoia and schizophrenia are polar opposite of each other, as while the first can be summarized as the incapacity to withdraw a decision or from taking any, the second is the incapacity to deal with decisions on a cognitive level. 

Refraining from choosing immediately the most logical (as a man would) or emotionally pleasant (as women tend to do) decisions and ignoring the others is necessary evolutionary feature: all animals need the flexibility to cope with an unpredictable *natural* world. For the same reason we also need the laser-like focused intelligence of paranoia, we need the mirror-like intelligence to represent things as they are without altering or <q>improving</q> on the bare result of our perception, while keeping an underlying sense of Self of identity. We need the capacity to withdraw from further action without giving in to the compulsion to reject or act on drives based on clearly limited knowledge, or demonstrably irrational or too fleeting emotions.

Proper dissociation happens when we stop perceiving mental contents that don't mesh together, and as time goes more or more that content loses connection with itself and the rest, until the perception of both the Self and reality crumble and we can't make sense of anything anymore.

To simplify things, in order to get back some stability, the reaction to an undesirable pulsion can be neurosis (burying the original unadulterated fantasies under the weight of more palatable, fake ones), psychosis or paranoia (easing tension by projecting ideas on the outside world or sometimes identifying to it) and lastly dissociation, by eliminating it completely.

Though the book does elaborate on likely psychological causes fuelling dissociation or *_cleavage_*, it is a cognitive problem directly induced by denatured molecules disturbing the brain's functions and natural harmony, destabilizing the mind. With years and traumatic experiences (which as we will see, have proven to be the norm in a Western upbringing, not the exception) this creates a schizoid mode of functioning, in which troublesome contents are stopped from making spreading discontent and unease by disappearing from sight and the effort required to make sense of an outside world difficult to understand and rather hostile, *gradually discarded*.

As such, while neurosis can be induced in animals with high enough stress, the levels of dissociation we see in society do not seem possible to induce in someone who grew up under raw food.

The drive or desire (having wild barebone doggy-style sex with your mother!) still exists, its energy is not disinvested, removed from the mind, but we loose track of it, a part of the mind itself becomes out of reach, left to rot and fragment further. The stronger the forclosed complexe/instinct, the more and faster the mind unravels, hence the most dire cases of schizophrenia often relate to childhood conflicts linked to love and guilt, carrying an existential weight unlike any other.

### Pedophilia

#### What to take away

In the strictest sense of the word, we claim th elabel of *pedophiles*. We love children, unconditionally. And we claim that sexual contacts with children are not inherently harmful, no more than with adults. Not only are they harmless in and of themselves, but moreover absolutely necessary to ensure a proper emotional and spiritual (meaning: paranormal or metapsychic) course of development. Adults should have the God-given mission to initiate children to a magical sexuality.

![](/Images/meta/juvenile_chimp_requires_sex_from_adult.mp4)

This conclusions stems logically from the existence of the metapsychic purpose of erotic pleasure.:
1. Needs having to do with one's immortal soul expectingly beget exceptional desires and drives from the youngest age as is evident in any culture even marginally less repressed than ours[^rollet][^Herouard][^revolution]. Ethnography, ethography (animal behaviours), ancient history, all also show the eagerness of children to engage in **erotic play with older individuals**.
2. Because those needs **must** be fulfilled, children **must** come wired to welcome the variety of sex acts they desire, according to their age, which thus can not, in and of themselves, cause harm either psychologically or physically.
3. There is always the underlying assumption that prepubescent children are hurt by contacts physiologically normal for adults, because the purpose of sex is reproduction. But it is not, so anatomical competency for sex does not have to correlate with genesic---reproductive---maturity.

![](/Images/meta/child-bride-marriage.webp "Early XXth child-brides, matches made in heaven")

Without repression fellatio, masturbation, oral sex and gentle fondling sought by children in natural condition from day 1, and vigorously so, from adults. In absence of objective measurements of vaginal or rectal growth in children, **what can be done at what age can not derive from theory alone**. Despite the common violent connotation of sodomy, it must be the least related to reproduction, and thus organic development to accept a penis (let alone a mere finger, as many kids do) also precedes puberty.

Even coitus---vaginal penetration---**may** be pleasurable and spontaneous from age 9, judging from modern and historical accounts alike, hinting at a dual function both reproductive and energetic/metasexual/hedonic.
{.important}


#### *consent*

**We national-naturalist do not believe in the modern notion of consent.**
{.important}

Using the gentleness fitting the age is but a matter of *common sense*: no one sane would try to shove a fifteen centimeter long penis in a small anus, and forcing anything would be less traumatic or psychopathic as with an adult.
Consent has no age, it doesn't even require consciousness or self-awareness: a cat tells well-enough what it finds enjoyable or is willing to put up with at any time. It would suffice to let the child determines himself what it wants, outside any pressure and intellectual expectation.

In accordance with history, biology, a century of clinical psychology and the personal testimonies of both <q>abusers</q> and consenting victims, most keeping from a positive to a delighted memory and living productive lives with no discernable trauma of any kind. An exhaustive list of evidences and arguments can be found on [Newgon.net](https://www.newgon.net/wiki/Guide_de_d%C3%A9bat), on all children-related topics. And top it all off, they are politically eerily close to us, very sympathetic with Nazism. Nazi pedophiles, what more to ask ?

On a psychologicla level, infantilizing children is the very cause for their current immaturity. History proves that they can become self-reliable before 10 and understand the implications of life and death, and we believe that **who can kill, can fuck**.
{.important}


#### Peer pressure and society-induced trauma

**Yet, we oppose sudden changes of laws.**
{.important}

1. As a child grows up in a highly repressive environment or cultural norms and talks about his experience, she will be labeled as a pervert and forced to denounce her lover, or suffer consequences, from legal punishment to social isolation or outright murder.
1. People abhor the idea of having sex with children because they **themselves** live love on an utterly uninspired material or <q>carnal</q> level missing the purpose of their existence, and by default project their own wretchedness on all relationships. Although we must stress, the number of actually violent pedophilic rapes are an extreme minority.

Chances are the kid **will** cave in to social pressure and gradually convince herself that she has been abused. A child cannot be expected to take on the whole of society and his parents *as most adults cannot either*. They will distort their memories to fit with social narratives, and this memory revision can occur immediately or years after, puberty when the adolescent enters sexuality on the same degraded level, that of repetitive coitus, which is easily symbolizd and conflated with rape. But even if everything is done perfectly with the best of intentions, which is almost unconceivable today with this food and the lack of initiation in early childhood, in most cases the victim under the influence of the dominant morality might interpret the relationship as rape, **afterwards**. So, we are absolutely pro-contact... **in theory, not in practice**.

## Conclusion

Our very survival depends on restoring the metapsychic instinctive complexity. There has been many movements in the past that exalted racial chauvinism with nothing to show for it, their goal was to found a White ethno-state completely detached from the social practices that made our people great in the first place, their relentless reactionary dogmas and purity spiraling only lead to hate, frustration, destruction and despair, and the suppression of individuals within their own groups that recognized these blatant contradictions.

{{% expurged %}}
Many will still retort that the White race is dwindling and reducing the number of breeders endangers it, as Himmler claimed. This argument makes no sense as even given an interrupted chain of pregnancies, the amount of intercourses required for impregnation is very small. On the contrary, the elimination of labor pains after a year of strict instinctive diet---and the life-changing calm of babies and children---will make pregnancies and parenthood much more attractive.
{{% /expurged %}}

However we differ from those people because we are not bound by any contrarian desire nor neurotic compulsion which manipulates our judgment, rendering us insensitive or spiteful towards the very forms of love that allowed true high cultures to blossom. Eros, which includes sexuality, is the greatest motivator for in-group preferences within your racial family *as satisfied people know nothing will ever satiate their desire better than their own ethnos*. {{% expurged %}}A good racist encourages anything creating stronger bonds between blood brethren.{{% /expurged %}} The logical outcome of love is sex and no honest person can claim to love his own people while endorsing socially repressive policies facilitating its destruction.

The need for repression would imply the innate corruption of nature, a hallmark of Judaism, the undying mortal enemy of Nordic humanity, and life on Earth as a whole. Instead, our solution is to embrace incest, pedophilia, homosexuality and shun coitus outside the two aforementioned situations. Then everything can be fine. There is no need to repress anything, just reeducate ourself, and get rid of unnatural impulses that should never develop in the first place.

Our researchs and conclusions, all taken together, portray a world where people would stay with their family with the longest time within extended tribes, with their sisters and brothers and cousins, and would raise the children together, sleeping together and teaching how to mature into master the divine forces of creation they were created to handled. Love and pleasure should be as natural and spontaneous, and no more stress-inducing or complex-ridden, than caressing one's hair.

[^oo]: Talking about <q>feelings</q> would be a mistake because these sensations are beyond feelings, it is not possible to separate the sensation of energy from the raw textures of consciousness, or you could say the two of them are more intrinsically bound than other sensory fields like sight or sounds. A reason might be that *extrasensory perceptions come from within, from consciousness itself*.
[^African]: Much like the customary African ethnic wars, Hutu vs Tutsi among the most puzzling given the utter lack of tension right before *husbands and wives* responded murdered one another and their children in cold blood, in the most horrific ways.
[^freud]: Similarly, Freud talked of *tender motions*choosing different objects than those subjects to *sexual* desire. Funnily enough he never mentioned <q>love</q> per se, not once in his library-filling heap of analyses instead using focusing on libido and desire or attachment. More than cynicism, he proved having an extraordinary insight into the nature of feelings.
The reality of mundaine love (of which he knew the gory ins and outs) is so fraught with with unhealthy, hidden and sinful content that a truly innocent feeling feeling is better deserved with an original expression with no such association. 
[^imp]: I assume that most readers will be either males, or adult females, hence most likely mothers. But the Oedipus complex can really apply to all older relatives indifferently, not just the mother, *and for both genders*.
[^mythogenesis]:
	```quote {#mythogenesis}
	The universality of the denunciation of a fault inherent in sexuality, with regard to the postulate of its metapsychic finality, could encourage us to highlight an unconscious function responsible for deciphering non-verbalized errors:
	we could thus define <q>mythogenesis</q> in as an innate and therefore universal process, aiming, through sublimation and symbol, to rekindle awareness of lost values ​​in us and restore them. One could see in it, like Freud, a simple defense by projection against internal suffering due to the vagaries of a repressive education. But we cannot rule out the hypothesis of a full-fledged psychic function, genetically determined in such a way as to guarantee the return to function of the PIM when living conditions systematically compromise its achievement.

	It joins Jung’s interpretation of the Unconscious, impulsing changes and political or artistic movements through history by possessing individuals, in reaction to collectively perceived needs and opportunities for change.

	The same broad lines are found in the myths of different cultures. Greek mythology represents the different aspects of the degradation of the human condition, from original faults symbolized for example by Typhon and Echidna, man and woman serpents, progenitors of all the monsters it depicts, including the sphinx of Thebes. **Quetzalcóatl, intoxicated by his wife, unites with her and from there emerges all the misfortunes of the Aztecs**.
	```
[^gland]: Possibly their secretions might even act as pheromones, especially their glands and whole hormonal system superactivates, such as seen in other contexts, chemically amplifying the primitive urge to copulate in weak males.
[^suppuration]:
	```quote{cite="[Suppurations de la région anale, 01/01/93](https://www.em-consulte.com/article/22135/suppurations-de-la-region-anale)"}
	These anal glands appear as glandular ducts to which no function is recognized and whose origin is unknown. They are lined with a cylindrical and stratified epithelium, identical to that of the mucosa of the transitional zone of the anal canal. They are present in all individuals and usually number six to ten. Each gland opens into the anal lumen at one of the crypts of the pectineal line, with one crypt accommodating two or three glandular orifices.
	```
[^amok]: And yet many women do have a difficulty with getting properly wet, **needing some more mechanical titillation of the breasts much like a cow for its milk**. If that adequate description disgust you, blame people, not me. No man can deny that this really is the absolute state of love.
[^dd]: For strange reasons they are not named in the English version of the article. The French version is more complete.
	```quote{cite="[Glande anale](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glande_anale)"}
	The anal glands, then called Hermann's and Defosses' glands, are located at varying depths in the wall of the anal canal, partly between the layers of the internal and external sphincter (in the "intersphincter plane"). Six to eight in number, they come together at the level of the anal crypts near the columns of Morgagni. (translated)

[^Herouard]:
	```quote{cite="Journal, 1601-1628" author="Jean Héroard, médecin de la cour de Louis"}
	[September 21, 1601](#) Madame the Duchess of Bar, sister of the King, who considered the parts so well formed of this beautiful body, having cast her sight on those which made him the Dauphin, turning towards Madame de Panjas, his lady-in-waiting, told him that he was well endowed. These words were received with derision, which carried them to the ears of the King, who was close to the Queen.
	[July 24, 1602](#) Louis takes pleasure and laughs out loud when the stireuse shakes his cock with her fingertip.
	[September 23](#) Very cheerful, excited; he makes everyone kiss his guillery.
	[September 30, Louis XII then is just **2 years old** ](#) At a quarter past twelve the Sieur de Bonières and his young daughter; he laughed out loud at her, rolls up, shows her his guillery, but especially to his daughter, because then holding her and laughing her little laugh **he shakes his whole body**. It is said that he meant finesse [that it was a salacious allusion](#). At twelve-thirty the Baron de Prunay; there was in his company a little damsel; he rolled up his coat, showed him his cock with such ardor that *he was quite beside himself*. He lay down on his back to show it to her.

	```quote{cite="Heretics of Dune"}
	The reawakening procedure was thoroughly fixed in his awareness, though. He knew that gholas once had been awakened by conditioning them unconsciously to attempt murder on someone they loved. The ghola psyche, shattered and forced to reassemble, was always psychologically scarred. This new technique left the scars in the one who managed the process. Emotional pain warred with his physical pains. Duncan felt incomplete. Something remained suppressed within him. The reawakening was not finished. He stared angrily at Teg. Was there more? Teg had been brutal. *Necessary brutality? Was this how you had to restore a ghola?*
	```
[^resistance]:
	```quote{cite="Chapterhouse of Dune"}
	Murbella murmured in his right ear: “My hands are fire”. Her body hid the faces behind the plaz. He felt the fire wherever she touched him. Abruptly, the flame engulfed his mind. Hidden places within him came alive. He saw red capsules like a string of gleaming sausages passing before his eyes. He felt feverish. He was an engorged capsule, excitement flaring throughout his awareness. Those capsules! He knew them! They were himself... they were... All of the Duncan Idahos, original and the serial gholas flowed into his mind. They were like bursting seedpods denying all other existence except themselves. The memories flooded him until he wondered how he could hold them all. He gasped in the grip of the serial memories that cascaded into him. All of those lives! All of those lives!

[^revolution]: The industrial Revolution and the century leading to it---in no small measure due to the increasing place stimulants such as coffee chocolate and sugar too from the colonies in all social classes from the head down---marked a milestone in the degeneracy of our attitude toward sex, and a still ongoing repression that few periods in record history if any ever demonstrated, with commonly practiced *surgical operations and lobotomies conducted for 150 years in the heart of Europe to combat masturbation*.

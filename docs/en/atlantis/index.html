But this linear summarization only works from a bird&rsquo;s view encompassing fifty millenia of change in diet morphology and culture sprawled all over Europe and Asia - minus that part 1-mile thick ice sheets used to cover - on all pre-existing populations.<p>Assumedly, anatomically modern humans identical to us remained content with a hunter-gatherer lifestyle for tens of thousands of years, building nothing. According to experts cultural development could not kick off, stuck to the caprices of nature and extremely inefficient agricultural practices until about 10ky BC. We are meant to believe people could not come up with grand dreams and constructions and science. Of course this is an outrageous over-simplification, but the pervading notion survives in science and the public, that intellectual progress could only stagnate and take off with writing. Even though we know <em>brain size continuously shrank</em>, not increased.<p>We don&rsquo;t always claim much originality, many authors have discussed these topics at length, with more or less success and intelligence. And we can only read so much with from ruins and sediments, the progress in archeological methods of analysis seemingly doing very little to get rocks to talk. From material remains alone archeology will not advance further conclusively. <em>Our unique insights on the other hand</em>, enable us to narrow down considerably what could or could not have happened in the past, allowing us to make logical guesses without favoring some findings upon anothers or unjustifiable leaps of faith.<p>Before we look at the evidences, there are intellectual arguments in favor of the possibility in the most remote antiquity before history, of a <em>lost cycle of civilization</em>, way beyond the primitive hunter-gatherer lifestyle on display by a few remaining wild tribes today. Firstly, it is possible that the number for Neanderthal population have been <em>underestimated</em>, as the two main assumptions normally taken for granted to determine past population density actually stand on <strong>shaky grounds</strong>:<ul><li>Historical hunter-gatherer cultures suffered from various diseases, seasonal difficulties in finding food, and in a some cases inter-tribal wars. All factors capping population density, but none that applied to paleolithic people, so the most common cause of death would be old age, followed by rare accidents, as
<a href=/en/viral_phenomenon/#truncated-lifespans-and-mental-diseases>undisturbed groups of chimpanzee seem to demonstrate</a>.<li>The longer-lived a race, the less people die in any given place in any given time. Even a highly populated (relatively speaking) place might leave very little bodies behind, because people don&rsquo;t die very often&mldr; one person per century or less ! <em>Higher lifespans would render common demographic estimations null.</em><li>Ultimately assuming a naive hunter-gatherer lifestyle just we find no evidence of human intervention, might be a
<a href=/en/neandertals/#gardeners-in-eden>mistake too</a>.</ul><p>Secondly, everything concurs with the notion of a <strong>gradual degeneration</strong>, both the paleontological data and what we know of the effects of the various forms of diet:<ul><li>Despite cooking being the one dividing as well as starting line of it all, reality is not so binary: there are degrees to diet sophistication, from boiling a random fruit to insane industrial processing and purely synthetic food.<li>Wide-scale cereal cultivation in particular did not take off before long, and if possible from the start, has not been the stapple (if not the only ) food for the majority of the species until the early Neolithics, as the first tools for

The first forms of cooking, that Primitives display, were very simple and it makes sense that genetic damages stacked up over time. And because not everyone adopted the various novelties at the same time world-wide then many groups of various states of degeneration and mixing must have cohabited for tens of thousands of years, with &ldquo;modern humans&rdquo; living side by side with Neanderthals for that long sometimes on the same site, overlapping so much that telling them apart often proves hopeless for experts.<p>And because psychic powers lifespan and puritiy of diet all correlate, it entails that gods and demi-gods did actually trod the Earth. Such stark differences in culture and human condition <strong>must</strong> have been accompanied by <strong>long-lasting, cultural dynamics through the ages</strong>, with nothing but the mightiest monuments to talk to us across unfathomable eons passing, several time that of recorded history with all memories of those primeval times fading into oral myths and legends. Giving rise, among other exemples, to the various tales of giants (not to be taken literally) and floods worldwide.<h3 id=ancient-high-technology class=headings><a href=#ancient-high-technology>Ancient high technology</a></h3><p>So it makes sense that different grades of men succeeding some closer to divinity or divinities themselves, succeeded one another. But reasoning alone only supports is no proof of forgotten historical cycles. Allusions and myths only at best make up for tempting hypotheses, the only admissible evidences for long lost technologically or spiritually advanced civilizations are out-of-place artifacts science can analyze and conclude unambiguously of its strangeness.<p>Many of these sites display obvious machining marks, and in the grooves, according to

And more importantly they never made the transition the West went through mid-XVIIIth century, vastly improving the efficiency regards to power transmission, without which industrialization would have been impossible. Due to this lack, until two centuries ago power appliances (be it electrical or gaz or steam) were technically impossible. Explaining why steam power despite its discovery never never outgrew its status of intellectual curiosity.<p>There is no issue with acknowleding a higher technological expertise to known ancient civilization, on the contrary, a lot of their knowledge wasn&rsquo;t written down and so were lost, to their descendants or then to us. The most famous cases being the formulas for Byzantine fire (a form of napalm) and Roman cement (a geopolymer), as well as the existence of analog machines like the Greek Antikitera device. However none of those things really contrast with what we knew before of their limitations. We know the limits of the capabilities of ancient people, the materials they could work with and basic engineering principles they could muster, according to what they built and left us.<br>For instance if classical antiquity made wonders with marble, they just never could do the same things with harder rocks like granite nor did they demonstrate having the capability to build and <strong>practically</strong> move (haul, position, etc in one piece) anything heavier than 300 tones, with extreme difficulty. This was the technical limits of ancient times, due to material resistance. Blocks too heavy simply sink in the ground, wood and ropes <em>snap</em>.<p class=important>Technical details become irrelevant in front of physical impossibilities.<blockquote class=aside><p>So, did Romans move the Trilithon blocks? &mdash; Absolutely not! Romans had no desire to move such weights, because they knew just as well as we do that they could not move even substantially smaller blocks.

However they had to make use pulleys, wheels, meta slege, steel capstans, iron ball-bearings and metal sledges, <em>all inventions unknown in antiquity</em>, the latest which didn&rsquo;t exist one century before. And not only was the transport journey extremely slow and harduous, with no more than 100 meters per day on land and two battleships at sea (making the feat harder to imagine being replicated over and over and over for Bronze Age people) but there are a lot of controversies surrounded that stone. While it is documented, contemporary eye-witnesses state that the original block couldn&rsquo;t be moved more than an inch, when Catherine felt satisfied and went home waiting for its arrival. Most of that story most likely was Russian propaganda (already&mldr;), which does not make sense, and if it did, would not substanciate the claim that primitive people could deal with those weights either.<p>Lastly there is a debate about the Great Pyramid: samples of mortar were taken in a good thirty places on many layers, confirming a datation loosely relative to dynastic Egyptians, seemingly corroborating the official datation to the Fourth Dynasty.

Not only its monuments but the 3 km² of the plateau itself must have been niveled and paved with enormous, perfectly interlocking blocks.<br>The massive scale of this undertaking, alleguedly <em>for no practical purpose</em>, hints not just as their incredible capabilities but at a deconcerting <strong>carelessness</strong> regards to the cost or efforts involved, made especially manifest when at times the most impressive or valuable blocks lay in the most random of places, <strong>out of view</strong>. We are thus laid to believe they had means to do pretty much whatever they wanted with rocks, <em>easily</em>, on the small or the enormous.

However, could Egyptians through Imhotep have come be credited for discovering a formula to that effect and loose it afterwards, could this really salvage the official human timeline ? Davidovitz argues that because one stele <em>might</em> indicate the knowledge of one formula to create ciment in one specific case in the Ancient Kingdom, then all sandstone blocks and slabs allegued to the Ancient Kingdom (circa 2700 BC – circa 2200 BC) must really be the product of dynastic Egyptians, <em>with no more than hand-held copper chisels or saws and pounding stones</em>, but casting stones with basic chemistry discovered by happenstance.<p>But They demonstrated they could dig into the bedrock over dozens upon dozens of meters, if not kilometers since the whole of the Giza plateau seems to be filled with tunnels like a gruyere, but they are forbidden to visit, alleguedly for security concerns. <strong>Such a task would be unthinkable with copper hammer and chisels, let us no kid ourselves.</strong><br>And quarries abound, with half-finished works, so many parts - including the heaviest, the two unfinished obelisks of Aswan (1100 tons and an estimated 1500), that Davidovitz ignores completely, arguing that granite was less than 0.1% of total blocks, totally natural, not carved but &ldquo;split&rdquo; and that workers would take 10 years to carve the sarcophagus&mldr; Ignoring completely the evidences that carving was used in the quarry (the scooping marks) and not splitting and&mldr; ignoring everyting inconveniencing his theory, as all self-satisfyed experts do.<br>Egyptians also had to manage lifting and moving such weights for kilometers on unequal terrains <em>without the wheel nor steel beering</em>, another feat chemistry wouldn&rsquo;t help with, an issue experts consistently handwave despite that it has
<a href=/#not_replicated>never been replicated since then</a> since then.<br>And casting doesn&rsquo;t solve the issue of the micrometric, <q>space age</q> level precision, achieving perfectly symmetrical lines and flat surfaces to the point of reflecting light on <em>granite</em> and harder, already in <strong>pre</strong>dynastic times. All that is simply and explicitely pushed aside, arguing that had to it somehow by taking years grinding their rock patiently. Sorry but time doesn&rsquo;t solve grant superhuman precision to see and maintain over a whole sculpture curved and symmetric geometric patterns and repeat it identically over a dozen others.<p>Whether on molds (which he rules out for any form of granite) or the crude blocks themselves, this today requiers industry-grade steel and power tools, <em>not with copper chisels</em>.<br>On both constructions and smaller pieces of art, the machining marks are evident, with Petri Flint and C.

And as with the pyramids no theory or even contemporary documents mean anything, as long the Ancients&rsquo; work can not be duplicated with a similar precision within a reasonable timeframe, with said allegued primitive (or even modern in some cases) methods.

Modern science is not born with Ancient Greeks, or Romans, or Medieval Europe or whoever else we consider initiated the slow, steady and mostly halphazard improvement upon existing crafts which led to today. <em>Modern science only took off those last 2OO years</em>.<p>It is the fundamental understanding of matter from its smallest components upwards, which makes building new machines possible - and maintening existing ones too since the more complex a device the more fragile it tends to be. As we saw in our own history, due to the accumulative nature of scientific knowledge, a progress unhinged by impeding ideologies (religion or mysticism) would feature a progress curve marked both by gradualism (like trades before, new experiments and theories correcting older ones) and a point of exponential inflexion as the knowledge base to build upon and make connections from keeps expanding, making new discoveries continuously easier, and the coherence of scientific theories deeper.<p>The possibility (in theory) for everyone to carry with him a part of the science of its tius and teach it to others reliably, would mean a catastrophe in order to erase that culture would need to kill off not just a select few groups, but huge swaths of a population, otherwise the survivors to cous back from it. This is the level of advancement the pyramid builders must have been at, pulling off marvels rivalling the best we can cous up with both in the big and the small.<p>Even nuking our whole world-wide civilization to oblivion, leaving only a few millions inhabitants (mere thousandths of today&rsquo;s figures) would do no more than setting back technology a few centuries back (Middle Age levels), with the huge caveat that the abondance of ruins and the persistence of rationalism and the scientifical method, would accelerate limit this tius due to reverse-engineering, to just one century.<p>So to us the most glaring logical fallacy with the idea of a lost civilization close to ours, is not so much the loss of technology itself, but the inability to replicate it in less than a millenia. Cultures lost techniques from tius to time, the most famous exemple being Greek fire, an early form of pneumatically-propelled napalm Byzantines used to terrorize their enemies with. But I argue this only happened because they knew the fire&rsquo;s recipe, not why it worked: with good notions of chemistry and thermodynamics one could deduce the necessary components to produce the desired effects, and the required apparatus.<p>So the question is: how advanced must their science have been (as opposed to mere techncal know-how) to produce the engineering skills who result we can still observe ? How advanced can one people get, even through a long time, without <em>accurate scientific theorization</em> ?<p>I don&rsquo;t think the long accumulation of skills alone comes close to accounting for the pyramids and its feats of mathematical precision that we are only able to measure recently. Such capabilities <strong>must</strong> imply some kinds of computers, and thus whole areas of science, power production and transmission, the teaching of advanced chemistry and materials physics. Yet without any of the above <em>undoubtedly leaving significant evidences in the ground if not above and underwater</em>, beside the buildings themselves.<p>Keeping with the assumption of a high tech civilization, the only way to solve this paradox, is to assuus a very different path to progress, with a drastically lower population even compared to the XIXth century industrial age. The same results can always be obtained in multiple ways and multiple techs. The most exquisite vases can be done by hands and limited, medieval human-powered machines<sup id=fnref:6><a href=#fn:6 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>6</a></sup>. The same could be said for

While possible this path has been discarded been discarded early 20th century by our own global civilization in favor of the (alleguedly) time-saving application of electrical power, automation fossil fuel and plastic.

However I believe the persistence of that belief for Atlantis&rsquo; proponents (making them such an easy target for normies&rsquo; and <q>Establishment&rsquo; scientists</q> joyful lampooning), comes from a <em>cognitive coping mechanism</em>.<p class=important>Serious honest researchers would rather settle with inconsistency than accepts (at least <em>publically</em>) an even more disturbing and harder-to-swallow alternative: the notion of an entirely different model of civilization, based on psychic abilities.<h3 id=sorcerers-with-automatons class=headings><a href=#sorcerers-with-automatons>Sorcerers with automatons</a></h3><p>In short we need to concile four sure facts:<ul><li><p>Those megabuilders have been all around the globe, spanning several continents, perhaps even Japan, so moving was a non-issue, suffered a few setbacks and <strong>lost capabilities over time, continuously</strong>.<li><p>Those most artefacts <em>left</em> are made of fairly natural materials with no composite, plastic or alloys, the tools they made them with, tools that left no trace, demonstrate a sophistication and precision exceeding our understanding, meaning that the science we would need to imitate them, is not yet available despite all our knowledge.<li><p>All known civilizations that had writing, unevitably left traces of it, on the walls, poteries, vases, archiving crypts, etc, and they were all conserved to some degree including for those wiped out by wars, fires, all manners of catastrophes&mldr; Famously clay tablets harden when burnt.<p class=important>Yet those megabuilders did not leave any writing, anywhere. <strong>They did not have or use writing.</strong><li><p>Systematic scientific progress like ours would have gifted them with many other inventions, useful in transport (cars, planes, trains), communication (telegram, radio, fax), food production, bunkers, concrete and plastic and other processed materials which would have literally littered the place, especially if they stayed in the same places for hundreds or thousands of years. They would have benefited hugely from the science we do not see directly in the monuments, but which would be absolutely implicit and inevitable to our current level, no matter how much more culturally different or religious their mindset would have been.</ul><p>We do not get composite materials more advanced than what we have in the 19th century<sup id=fnref1:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup> without computer, microscopy, spectroscopy, chemical sensors.

As the last two centuries proved, all branches of physical science progress together and support each other, and the higher you go the more interdependent these branches become.<p>On the other hand&mldr; if the tools and specific machines needed were obtained through magic and not the slow and systematic scientific method, then indeed, they would not have had any of the above which would have been extremely useful to rebuild, salvage and regroup.<blockquote class=important cite="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNC_HRxf0XA&list=PLb1MDIWaJM6kQpScFjbspwReCNP31X6cx&index=3">Every explanation for how the pyramids were built or what they were used for, can be debunked, more or less.

Both material culture and concepts are indeed, the way Marx described, a linear product of the economic and ideological context in which their occur.<p>New concepts, intellectually speaking, can only add very little on earlier notions. The scientific method requires reproductible experiences and a systematic study of matter, and always aim at synthesis, a theory explaining everything all possibilities. This any group could carry on given enough time and resource, not needing - in theory - any intuition. Truth can only be attained in any area of science, after an infinite time, with investment in research returning an ever diminishing profit.<p>On the opposite a people still with a firm grasp on its psychic nature would access visionary truth from the vintage point of <em>completed eternity</em>, essentially allowing for <em>instant progress</em>, visions requiring only a minimum of concepts necessary for the application of the messages perceived. Someone possessed by energy lives, like animals, in a state of eternal present. The distinction between present and future fades, hence so does causality, with the sense of present and future existing at the same time.<br>The idea of a comprehensive scientific worldview - a coherent unification of the salient facts and a rigorous application of determinism to the world as a whole - disappears, in front of a <em>fundamentally irrational</em>, infinite universe where <em>anything could happen</em>. In this context, understanding everything becomes a mere <em>affectation</em>.<p>There is no need to <strong>arrive</strong> at our level: information, its purpose and understanding are (ideally) received at once. Theoretically, for whatever issue, the solution appears fitting whatever context they were in. Regards to rock softening, any protocol for the synthesis of any desired chemical compound using local plants and minerals in a reasonable time, complete with all steps taking into consideration the means available, were certainly received, <em>without the need to know anything about nucleophilic substitution reactions, electronic orbitals, chirality or the strength of chemical bonds</em>.<p>For such a culture, the microscopic minuties of creation, of little meaning for a primate living in the real world, would most likely never need or find an explanation, even though any detail however precise could be obtained if the need for it ever arised.

Or whose achievements they actually <em>inherited from a precursor culture who did the research, before disappearing without a trace</em>.<li>The state of technology of that culture would at odds with itself, in some aspects breathtakingly advanced, able to produce results of astounding, almost magical efficacy, with others areas on the contrary typical of very <em>simple</em> primitive periods of our history. We can expect inspired people would gravitate toward the simplest yet most satisfying technical solution for any need, with little concern for our logic.</ul><p>We would observe constructions or objects dedicated to elementary mundane human needs (like drinking, eating and housing) but made with an uncomprehensible quality, that would havey with no right to exist, both for the same period we credit it too and regards to said simple purpose, <em>just because they could and it looked better</em>.<br>Case in point those thousands of vases with no particular pattern or imagery whatsoever indicating any particular religious or cultural significance for the people who made them, and which would have justified an enormous effort put into them.

So the Younger Drias Impact catastrophe brought to an end the delicate balance Atlanteans had arrived at, and the source of their unique abilities (along with their entire culture) evaporated in what appears as an historical heartbeat, as if the people had been forced to flee yet <em>never attempted</em> to salvage <em>the yet abundant ruins</em>.<p>Because they couldn&rsquo;t do so. Reverse-engineering would make no sense if their technology was based on magic, either/or to make it or use it. For the same reason neither the originators or survivors could not stave off their ongoing metapsychical degeneration, probably due to cooked food worsening over a long, long time. I can only assuus that no one like Guy‑Claude could state the issue in rational terms, which anyone with a basic education today could understand if it wasn&rsquo;t for people&rsquo;s wilful refusal to listen to simple truths.<p>Arguably, a people of such love for beauty of the highest kind, if also equipped with an elementary bases in genetics and molecular chemistry should have cous to the same realization as Guy‑Claude Burger did, about cooked food, raw food and the extrasensory. The natural end point of the development of the rational intellect, has been to figure out the reasons for our degeneration and all the mistakes of said intellect along the thousands of years.<p>So it stands to reason, that if an Aryan people, so much smarter and genetically purer on top of that has had access to our intellectual comprehension, they would have figured all of that quickly and survive about anything nature would throw at them. As a matter of fact the technology to cross oceans is actually miniml (by migrating elsewhere, multiple multiple other countries, as many hunter-gatherer did but initiate the regeneration of their full ancestral state, the same same process national-naturalistm is spearheading.<p>And the fact they didn&rsquo;t, proves they lacked our rational understanding.<p>This - in theory could be the power of science, of the <strong>Fruit of Knowledge</strong>: To completely separate knowledge and power from one&rsquo;s subjectivity and state of mind and inspiration, and reach material truth. This allowed for terrible destruction, giving the power of the atom in the hands of perfect nobodies without any regard for their mental spiritual or emotional widsom state of mind of an individual. So much so that a dumb computer devoid of any soul - so by design honest to a fault - would only need to follow the chain of arguments to arrive one after to arrive logically at the same conclusion.<p>However, as always relative, circonstancial and impermanent material knowledge is, <em>hard sciences outside all cultural references are also universal and absolute</em>. While it can not handle the mystery of the soul, it is the systematic exploration of the physical world, that gave us the concrete understanding of the effect of cooking, race mixing and coitus.<p class=info>The intellect, that led us astray in the first place by usurping the dominant function the extrasensory should fill, was also the only quality which could put an end to the degeneration, to the Fall of its own making. The fulfillment of its mission in the history of mankind, was to lead us to these revelations in this very century, and ultimately to the National-Naturalist movement and the regeneration of Aryan species to its former glory by means of eugenics, an advanced diet copying apes to the utmost, and lastly in sexuality, through the wilful extirpation of culturally induced morality in sexuality, leaving our bare insincts to be <strong>thoroughly</strong> realized in all directions.<hr><h2 id=why-the-megalithic-andean-architecture-in-peru-and-the-sacred-valley-is-older-than-the-incahttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvoxuib1vhdjmlistplb1mdiwajm6ndgviubioliauk4znwk-fy class=headings><a href=#why-the-megalithic-andean-architecture-in-peru-and-the-sacred-valley-is-older-than-the-incahttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvoxuib1vhdjmlistplb1mdiwajm6ndgviubioliauk4znwk-fy><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxuiB1vhDjM&list=PLb1MDIWaJM6nDgVIUbIOlIaUK4znWK-Fy" rel="external nofollow" target=_blank>Why the Megalithic Andean Architecture in Peru and the Sacred Valley is older than the INCA!</a>:</a></h2><p>lack of knoweldge about southamerica: all destroyed by conquistadors and spaniards and slaughtered a huge portion of the people living there. included the deliberate destruction of all the artefacts, <em>records and writings</em>.<figure id=porphyry><figcaption>Porphyry stones in Ollantaytambo</figcaption><a role=presentation target=_blank href=/Images/history/lost-civs/templo-sol-ollantaytambo.webp><img src=/Images/history/lost-civs/templo-sol-ollantaytambo.webp srcset="/Images/history/lost-civs/templo-sol-ollantaytambo.webp 800w, /Images/history/lost-civs/templo-sol-ollantaytambo_hubf0b1c7a1ac5bef73f29d5b38c857272_424416_604x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 604w, /Images/history/lost-civs/templo-sol-ollantaytambo_hubf0b1c7a1ac5bef73f29d5b38c857272_424416_400x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 400w, /Images/history/lost-civs/templo-sol-ollantaytambo_hubf0b1c7a1ac5bef73f29d5b38c857272_424416_200x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 200w" loading=lazy alt="Porphyry stones in Ollantaytambo" title="Porphyry stones in Ollantaytambo" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, (max-width: 600px) 50vw, 400px" width=800px height=533px style=--height-limit:533px></a></figure><ul><li>Ollantaytambo:<blockquote cite=https://www.ancient-wisdom.com/peruollantiatambo.htm>A Pre-Inca fortress, with rock walls of tightly fitted blocks weighing over 50 tons each

But in sous cases the rocks were thrown in front of the cellular style, so these pieces of Uran Pacha had to be there in the first place. So even if the monolith erosion indicates its higher age one wave of destruction (maybe one of them !) must have occured between the second style and the Inca work.<p>Potentially three different occupation stages, each separated by a different cataclysm.<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8huESgg9Od0&ab_channel=AndeanMegalithicTechnology" rel="external nofollow" target=_blank>Andean megalithic technology</a><hr><blockquote><p>Show pictorial or written evidence that they did this.<br>The problem here is the extant tools available to examine were all small handheld tools, fine if you are discussing small items, less fine when discussing megalithic sizes, indeed if we take the length of the piece cut we can safely say it would take not much more to do a length a few times that to the same depth because the full reach of the arm will easily do so, but longer than say 4x the piece will not be done in the same time because one has to move, so as soon as you have a length longer than maximal arm reach, you need another like amount of time-Or another person but along a length only a certain number of people can work.<br>Now we have no pictorial or written evidence of long saws to do this nor any artefact to support so we are guessing, but give the benefit of the doubt and claim that which we have evidence for was used, or even longer saws. So, a cube has 8 faces to cut to give it the shape free of the surrounding unshaped rock.<br>So we can say at the wear rate of the copper, we need a lot of copper blades, so we should be able to show extensive amounts of copper and copper mining somewhere to provide the tools-We don&rsquo;t have this.<br>Then we have the water and sand or other abrasive agent, some of which could be reused but even so the wind and mingling with larger pieces of rock will demand tons upon tons of abrasive.<br>We have no evidence of extensive stores or transport of this.<br>And water, even if done beside the source, the water needs pumping.<br>All these alleged solutions always fail. Why, they are not doing to completion and are ignoring the reality.<br>For GOOD evidence:<br>Set up to complete 3 blocks the relevant size, then organise (and this organisation is part of the total time) who works when, get your stone from the nearest quarry, transport to where you deem it should be fully dressed, it being transported according to how you best feel it was. Use the tools you believe were used, use toilet facilities you believe were there.<br>Factor any on site breaks deemed necessary but with say 3+ workers this should permit a continual rotation, once you have quarried the 3 lumps of granite, moved them and cut them and logged the amount of water and abrasive used, and how many tools gone through and have 3 perfect blocks completed, THEN you can pretend you have solved a mystery but as it stands, you gave us an idea that lacks wider considerations of working issues like transport, proving the tools, feeding, water and abrasive quantities needed, tool turnover rate. And simply wasted 3.5 hours to cut a thin sliver into the granite. IE you have proved YOU can do what YOU did, you have NOT proven to a scientific standard that that would meet the rate required to build whatever you are trying to prove.<br>So let us not be dishonest</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt1MsjMg_4M&ab_channel=UnchartedX" rel="external nofollow" target=_blank>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt1MsjMg_4M&ab_channel=UnchartedX</a><hr><p>that&rsquo;s well enough I think to realize their science was completely different, since they could do better than us without writing.<br>[02:41]Sentinel166: yes, if they had lived there for quite some time (given the Toksha burial, at least 14500 ago), one would expect them not to building all the time, so a castrophe of sort would have interrupted a few works (and destroyed others) but a lot of them<br>[02:42]Sentinel166: but at the same time given the sheer scale of the vestiges, especially the temples, we are sure they did live here<br>[02:43]Sentinel166: and then, if some of these high-tech places were done after the cataclisms, that means they still had a lot of power, so wouldn&rsquo;t they repair/continue the unfinished works ?<hr><p>Often nomadic, this was the only way of life for humans until about 12,000 years ago when archaeologic studies show evidence of the emergence of agriculture.

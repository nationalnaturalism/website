They understood very well that lasting gains require honesty and trust. A good capitalist can not be purely materialist or obsessed by money, as it would be the best way to lose it all.<p>The level of collectivism, be it centrally directed or down to various levels of local community has changed from period to period for a single country, or between cultures. Inspired countries have practiced all these and fared quite well. On one extreme Venice derived its wealth from international business and private initiatives, while the Inca Empire, on the other hand, relied on agricultural production controlled and directed by central authorities, through governmental agents - deemed of an excellent moral standing and incorruptibility by the Conquistadors, fact worthy of mention - dispatched everywhere. If Gammal Abdel Nasser was an assumed socialist, Pinochet was very liberal, widely successful and inventing his own model of State, minarchism.<p>The range of possible pro-genetic economic models are large, almost all-encompassing. Because the human factor, charisma, is paramount. This, plus some basic common sense ensured the success of all good regimes throughout time. Regulations, planification and the administrative (representing public interests) direction of the means of production have always existed, even in the most liberal or minimalist State. This is mere common sense, as Léon Degrelle said:<blockquote><p>In the human desert, where there are so many lambs, there are lions.</blockquote><p>The <dfn>three main problems with the Soviet planned economy</dfn>
were:<ul><li>The brewing of individualism in people, progressively unwilling to work for a system rewarding them with neither human dignity or a significant purchasing power, nor even basic necessities much of the time.<li>The overcentralization of planning, with no regard for communities or individuals, inducing a stifling rigidity and no organic liaison at the local level.<li>The absence of respect for personality, due to the communist emphasis on egalitarianism.</ul><p>The more complex and bureaucratic an institution the less efficient it is. But much of this complication came from an overarching central command, making no organizational sense. Administration should be decentralized as much as possible, instead of reflecting global social distrust and the compulsive need of a paranoid State to control its people.<p>But the innermost driving force of this historical failure was Soviet&rsquo;s <em>dialectical materialism</em>. It&rsquo;s Marxism or Judaism. No soul could be thought to exist hence no aspiration could be born from it, accelerating the rise of individualism or nihilism. As the cement to a lasting connection to a greater community is true love, notoriously absent from communist thought. In Mao&rsquo;s China, love was outright labeled as <em>bourgeois</em> and Lenin deemed erotic affection a loss of energy that should rather be spent in working.<p>The new world order should be based on nature, and everyone would integrate in it like bees as in a country-sized beehive. Which is not to say that the usual <q>freedom</q> of circulation, purchase and expression would disappear as in Stalinist regimes: a State whose public sector fails to provide all the goods expected from consumers, let alone cater for spiritual needs, should not attempt to substitute itself to the private sector lest people grow resentful, degenerate and <strong>beliefs in the ideals die</strong>.<p>If communism demonstrated that socializing the means of production fails when enthusiasm lacks and the leadership has no soul, on the other hand National-socialism discovered that a sound people possessed by an inspired idea and unfettered by past ideologies, will naturally find a working balance between collectivism and liberalism fitting the circumstances and availability of resources. A people loving their Führer and trusting in the future, will work with morality and reflect this in its laws, whether as public servants, serfs, factory workers or industry tycoons<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup>.<p>The unavoidable concentration of capital is an historical inevitability apparent in our societies for a century already, effectively eliminating competition in most industry branches beside the most minute and superficial (often artistic) details, while the inner parts get produced by a limited few companies often owned by the same shareholders. In these integrated branches technically speaking the difference between capitalism and socialism all but disappeared: The only important question is how these fortunes are invested.<br>The interest of the community, or the profit of a few ? Workers whose condition never improve, do not care if these fews hail from the entrepreneurial bourgeoisie, or the soviet <em>nomenklatura</em>.<p>Next, command economies still suffer from this problem of people&rsquo;s changing needs and wishes. It is true that predicting them, especially in the long term, has proved a daunting task at the very least, as individual desires are intrinsically fickle.<p>The reason behind this constant need for innovation and novelties, lies mostly behind an inner spiritual and erotic dissatisfaction. True spiritual nourishment increases social and cultural stability, leading not to stagnation but to equilibrium, a slow pace of change reflecting the real mutual adaptation of people and their environment throughout a time span of up to tens of millennia instead of being
<a href=/en/incest/#psyche>dictated by a neurotic psyche</a>. Social habits and needs should stem from blood. Socialization of people, and their gradual rise in intelligence and spiritual affinity will establish an uniformity of material culture, simplifying predictions and planification considerably.<h3 id=evil-of-competition class=headings><a href=#evil-of-competition>Evil of competition</a></h3><p>Experience proved even in Germany the danger of competition as an organizing principle, especially in war times. Yet war itself, be it physical or ideological, is the only condition the national-naturalist State will ever know for the longest time, until its purpose - to conquer the world and save it from subhumanity - has been achieved.<p>The most intuitive behavior for a tightly knit community is to share strengths, instead of hoarding resources and information to backstab one another at the first occasion. We are not interested in an ethnostate united only against outsiders, but divided among ourselves. This is the <strong>Israeli</strong> model, not ours.<p>Liberalism - the purest form of capitalism - supposes an open and fluid market with little initial investment and many producers, with the possibility of becoming one themselves in absence of satisfying options. Those conditions are all invalidated in today&rsquo;s economies. Markets creating the most values in our society - namely, industries - are highly granular, with enormous initial investments to enter them, and often requires a long training or education necessitating a life-long career choice.<p>Primitive societies alike share everything within family groups or clans, and engage in barter with other tribes depending on affinities and extended family ties. Later on money appeared, and with it the possibility (or rather, the increased ease) of speculation, profiting. This, gaining more than you offered in exchange, is the root of evil in the capitalist system. Trade without speculation is possible, but still relates to <em>a state of mind irreconcilable with loving your competitors, whose prosperity directly undermines yours</em>. Competition, when associated with material gains, leads to resentment and is thus immoral.<p>Trade has been thought as such for 1500 years under the guidance of the Catholic Church, though the idea is far older. I just mean this Institution did indeed hold considerable sway on cultural perceptions and not always for the worst, as its weakening led to the advent of materialism and the Industrial Revolution, and an untold suffering and dehumanization on a scale never seen before in Europe.<p>As Sturgeon said:<blockquote><p>I told him, all the same, he could get a lot higher prices for the little he did trade. He just laughed a little and shook his head. <q>You have to pay for what you get or it’s no good. If you <q>Trade well,</q> as you call it, you finish with more than you started with; you didn’t pay. That’s as unnatural as energy levels going from lesser to greater, it’s contrary to ecology and entropy.</q> Then he said, <q>You don’t understand that.</q> I didn’t and I don’t.</blockquote><p>Within a family, socialism is the most natural model. Our State is the racial family, hence citizens should collaborate to meet a given production volume/quality. This was incidentally the principle of medieval corporations: competition had a place though, but it was a competition over quality, emulation and innovation in its most beautiful form: the collective interest of the workers (including the apprentices) and the difficulty of becoming a master testified of their skills. Far from a free for all, thanks to an enormous wealth stored collectively institutions ensured a decent living for a decent work as well as a mandatory welfare system before nation-states existed.<p>On the other hand the unregulated pursuit of one&rsquo;s own selfish interest brought about the general dumbing down of products behind the back of consumers, the eternal incentive to skim a few bucks on security measures and workers&rsquo; legitimate income, programmed obsolescence and relinquishment of quality standards in favor of a global scale mass production.<p>The only way to once again promote durable products lasting centuries, using costly materials and fair working conditions, is heavy State intervention, directly or in a manner delegated to authorities, the self-government of trusted craftsmen and craftswomen, working hand in hand with the central authority.<br>Such social bodies would educate producers and subsidize their investment in better materials and machines. They would provide both the human and financial capital, to elevate producers to the level of contributing himself to said body, through dues and his accumulated experiences.<p>Public supervision of all the production process and absence of real competition will lower prices without the fear of unforeseen and capricious economic conjectures threatening producers. Because individual economic actors know very little about all others in free market societies, especially about competitors, under capitalism making predictions and sound investments for the future is a needlessly impossible guesswork, leaving behind many small companies and independent workers behind if not on the street, while the control of production will allow for efficient long-term allocation of resources (both human and material).<p>The patent system is the most perfect and worst example of the capitalistic mindset. Inventions and methods hoarded for profit and out of distrust for each other, instead of freely shared in order for all to learn the lessons of each other&rsquo;s efforts ! The aptest analogy in biology would be cancerous cells characterized by their theft of common resources and refusal to communicate normally with others.<p>The <q>invisible hand of the market</q> would naturally cause unknowing consumers to seek the cheapest products, all too eager to rationalize their choice, while producers will seek to make the most of the smallest investment, at the price of quality. Creating a pressure on all producers toward lowering the norm save for losing its market share, and quickly consumers can not find good products anymore. Hence for an accelerated uniformization of food quality and a degree of ecological compliance the State needs in all matters of production - norms<sup id=fnref1:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup>.<p id=norms_standardization>Free markets also supposes that buyers make rational choices and that the information on the market is freely available. This couldn&rsquo;t be further from the truth. Sellers do not want to spill the beans on their dirty secrets, nor divulge commercial or industrial secrets to their competitors.<br>It also supposes buyers can understand the finer technical qualities and inner working of their products, instead they only grossly know what it&rsquo;s supposed to be, based on advertisements. Yet this expert knowledge should be necessary to impact the market&rsquo;s future evolution in a sense aligned with producers&rsquo; and consumers interests.<br>Many technical markets such as computers or programming languages, would have followed very different paths in their international standards or industrial deployment norms. In order to cause the adoption of sound standards and architectures that benefit everyone and future growth, under current conditions <em>thousands to millions of consumers would have to become experts to pressure the market in the right direction</em>.<figure><figcaption>Good ol&rsquo; tireless landa !</figcaption><a role=presentation target=_blank href=/Images/nazi_holocaust_weimar_ww2/lada_soviet_car.webp><img src=/Images/nazi_holocaust_weimar_ww2/lada_soviet_car_hu871532d9dc17f55b2b2a4d98bdfb7cee_1266932_800x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp srcset="/Images/nazi_holocaust_weimar_ww2/lada_soviet_car_hu871532d9dc17f55b2b2a4d98bdfb7cee_1266932_800x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 800w, /Images/nazi_holocaust_weimar_ww2/lada_soviet_car_hu871532d9dc17f55b2b2a4d98bdfb7cee_1266932_604x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 604w, /Images/nazi_holocaust_weimar_ww2/lada_soviet_car_hu871532d9dc17f55b2b2a4d98bdfb7cee_1266932_400x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 400w, /Images/nazi_holocaust_weimar_ww2/lada_soviet_car_hu871532d9dc17f55b2b2a4d98bdfb7cee_1266932_200x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 200w" loading=lazy alt="Picture of an old soviet Landa car" title="Good ol' tireless landa !" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, (max-width: 600px) 50vw, 400px" width=800px height=467px style=--height-limit:467px></a></figure><p>With erotic energy, we discover material necessity and hardships are not the only drives impulsing creativity and hard work, nor the best.

<a href=/en/instincto/#what-a-natural-diet-is>such as various fruit trees and vegetables instead of grains and legumes</a>.<p>This need to revolutionize the food production sector also provides a solution to the inflated tertiary sector and consumer culture, by conveniently shifting a large part of the workforce to the primary sector. This should suffice to absorb more than the majority of the population’s workforce for the first generations, even motivating further demographic growth.<p>The first source of economic activity should be bolstering military defense and research (as well as energy and R&amp;D), closely followed by putting most people back to <strong>growing whole forests and revitalizing agricultural lands</strong>.<p>It will also foster a culture of self-sufficiency and local resilience (a strategic value of paramount importance in case of war or any situation of stretching resources). Each family will partake in the growing of <em>victory gardens</em> like those from WW2 as a social duty, except on a much bigger scale.<p>Quickly enough, these robust products will cause markets to dwindle so that a <em>green</em> capitalism based on perpetual growth doesn&rsquo;t make any sense in the end: the only model or philosophy matching a modern but non-consumerist society at equilibrium (past the transition period) is essentially a command economy wherein main social investment not conducive to profits (or which no company of sane size could tackle anyways) are decided beforehand, while small details are sorted out on an as-needed basis, locally.<p>The industrial production sector itself needs revitalization as well. The fact much of it was outsourced to the third world is to play a positive role, giving us the opportunity to practically start anew.<p>We will build a thoroughly planned-out structure for our national industries in which we will incentivize those needs considered crucial for national security and social well-being, such as various tools needed for craftsmen, computational power, mechanization and automation, necessary consumer items, and most importantly the defense sector which should be the driving force behind the entire society.<p>Until now devaluations and inflation have been devised centrally (be it in the US, UK, or Brussels) to please capitalist interests of share-holders and bankers in order to ensure their continuous profiteering at the detriment of workers. We promote the opposite, the adoption of the National-Socialist financial system and money based on the work of a high-trust productive society. The more trust in one’s own intelligence and skills, the more luxury a Völk can allow itself, confidence in its capacity to compensate with more work or more production later on.<p>The unavoidable isolation of a renewed racist ethno-State, will find its solution in the formation of separate economic zones on the basis of barter and bilateral recognition of economic needs and values of national goods, between like-minded countries of similar lifestyle and capacities. As a good explanation of these mechanisms, we defer to an excellent book<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup>.<p>Like Germany, we should regulate the volume and value of money until the people have been socialized and its lifestyle streamlined&mldr; simplified enough to permit the <em>direct administrative control of more and more of the economy by local authorities</em>, with people ultimately concentrated in garden-cities or otherwise self-sufficient units. Each community would maintain the level of technology of its liking, leading necessarily to humbler individual needs.<p>Even communists acknowledged the efficiency of that system: the fact that basically National-Socialists did what they did, but <strong>made it work</strong>.<blockquote>The state, which is simply the Nazi Party, is in control of everything. It controls investment, raw materials, rates of interest, working hours, wages. The factory owner still owns his factory, but he is for practical purposes reduced to the status of a manager. <em>Everyone is in effect a state employee, though the salaries vary very greatly. The mere efficiency of such a system, the elimination of waste and obstruction</em> is obvious. In seven years it has built up the most powerful war machine the world has ever seen.</blockquote><cite>George Orwell, 1941—</cite><p>In pre-Industrial society the primary (agricultural) sector of the economy was enough to service it almost in its entirety and plenty of people survived on basic subsistence farming, selling off any agricultural surplus to the small towns and cities. Existing industries were negligible in proportion of population, though important politically and well regulated through joint cooperatives known as corporations and artisan guilds, mostly served the primary sector through the production of high-quality tools or weapons for the army.<p>However following the industrial revolution agriculture progressively transformed, farmers now no longer having to employ many laborers to service the fields manually. As a result a large bulk of the workforce slowly shifted towards industrial jobs, or suddenly, literally forcing their population into factories in the case of England, dramatically reducing their health and standard of living.</p><a role=presentation target=_blank href=/Images/history/england_child_workers_miners.webp><img src=/Images/history/england_child_workers_miners.webp srcset="/Images/history/england_child_workers_miners.webp 486w, /Images/history/england_child_workers_miners_hue03ec7cacf5dcfb7304e023b81d21f6d_74362_400x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 400w, /Images/history/england_child_workers_miners_hue03ec7cacf5dcfb7304e023b81d21f6d_74362_200x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 200w" loading=lazy alt="Photographs of child miners in England" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, (max-width: 600px) 50vw, 400px" width=486px height=257px style=--height-limit:257px></a><p>The population divide of early capitalism led to an increasingly small minority of exploiters and an increasingly poor majority of exploited workers, an intrinsic dichotomy of capitalism that Marx (and a few others) saw clearly. Industrialization also unleashed a wholly different beast unlike anything seen before, because the rise of manufacturing capabilities led to the first forms of consumerism, wherein the market started competing to service the ever changing (and often frivolous) consumer needs and desires through various products and gadgets.<br>This model was based on the expansion of a middle class both producing and consuming, giving some stability to the system from a sociological point of view.<p>But these trends proved chaotic and constantly shifting (trends rising and falling) due to mostly uncontrollable psychological factors, reducible to cooking and psychosexual frustration which we covered previously. From the end of World War II until the early seventies, the extension and intensification of liberalism had mirrored and accompanied in the West the increase in workers&rsquo; rights and purchasing power.<p>Wealth differentials between the different classes of people didn&rsquo;t really change with centuries passing, arguably studies show society is more hierarchical, structured, immobile and unfair than at any time ever in history. So the relative wealth of the working class hasn&rsquo;t really improved that much. But as far as the amount of goods we can acquire, absolute wealth skyrocketed. Most people are materially richer than 95% of the whole of society at any moment in history.<figure><figcaption>According to the Chinese Communist Party: <q>A perfectly healthy water</q></figcaption><a role=presentation target=_blank href=/Images/history/china_dead_fish.webp><img src=/Images/history/china_dead_fish.webp srcset="/Images/history/china_dead_fish.webp 531w, /Images/history/china_dead_fish_hu837b9d67198435c283a0748892034aa7_264316_400x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 400w, /Images/history/china_dead_fish_hu837b9d67198435c283a0748892034aa7_264316_200x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 200w" loading=lazy alt="Lots of dead fish surfacing on a Chinese lake" title="According to the Chinese Communist Party: A perfectly healthy water" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, (max-width: 600px) 50vw, 400px" width=531px height=411px style=--height-limit:411px></a></figure><a role=presentation target=_blank href=/Images/history/chemical_pollution.webp><img src=/Images/history/chemical_pollution_hu5e60655da94ffe5c15771b6d589a6bfb_845014_800x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp srcset="/Images/history/chemical_pollution_hu5e60655da94ffe5c15771b6d589a6bfb_845014_800x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 800w, /Images/history/chemical_pollution_hu5e60655da94ffe5c15771b6d589a6bfb_845014_604x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 604w, /Images/history/chemical_pollution_hu5e60655da94ffe5c15771b6d589a6bfb_845014_400x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 400w, /Images/history/chemical_pollution_hu5e60655da94ffe5c15771b6d589a6bfb_845014_200x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 200w" loading=lazy alt="Depiction of chemical pollution in China" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, (max-width: 600px) 50vw, 400px" width=800px height=400px style=--height-limit:400px></a><p>The rise of true evil however concurred only with the advent of our modern era, with the appearance of the interconnected and global economy, which suddenly created a peculiar situation in western countries, capitalists and oligarchs suddenly understood that the increased worker rights no longer allowed the same profit margins as before to be made, and for this reason they tapped into the huge workforce of the third world, suddenly shifting the bulk of our manufacturing capabilities to countries such as China and other Asian states considered undeveloped.<p>This entailed a complete disaster, as the already established environmental and worker protection laws present in the west were completely ignored in these countries, which led to the insane environmental damage in the form of heavy metal and microplastics pollution in the ocean, and extensive rainforests destruction we witness today, all endorsed or even encouraged so CEO Mr Bergstein could earn a few more shekels.<figure><figcaption>No coke on those lips,<br><em>but it sounds similar</em></figcaption><a role=presentation target=_blank href=/Images/history/coca_ad.webp><img src=/Images/history/coca_ad.webp srcset="/Images/history/coca_ad.webp 610w, /Images/history/coca_ad_hub52c7b292b3111f280d9446d9b632168_507382_604x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 604w, /Images/history/coca_ad_hub52c7b292b3111f280d9446d9b632168_507382_400x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 400w, /Images/history/coca_ad_hub52c7b292b3111f280d9446d9b632168_507382_200x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 200w" loading=lazy alt="Erotic woman" title="No coke on those lips,\

Having to run between two points, eventually taking a bit more time, does not degrade the quality of life but enhance it tremendously. In a great many number of cases, modern societies have become <strong>less</strong> economically speaking in fulfilling the same or equivalent tasks: social inertia has made those tasks a lot more complicated, and robust, smart (relatively) low-tech solutions to old problems. Nearly all problems societies know, have been around for a very long time already indeed, and needs have been met with for equally as long, as soon as possible. Otherwise, solutions evolve slowly.<p>On the contrary, new sudden problems seemingly requiring technological solutions are almost always not resulting from social needs but as byproduct, side-effects of technology. The useless consumer society and hyper-industrialization have created cheap knock-out products of stupidly low quality, it brought us programmed obsolescence, an untold level of pollution absolutely unimaginable for previous generations, the near total loss of the whole Amazonian forest, and a bit closer to us, frequent traffic jams which see ever more powerful cars actually being slower than velocycles. While making everyone sick.<h3 id=adequate-technology-levels class=headings><a href=#adequate-technology-levels>Adequate technology levels</a></h3><p>We need <strong>adequate</strong> levels of technology to meet needs, and first and foremost address the social root of each issue by changing habits: less material needs (or less technological ways to go about them) make for less work, liberating (whenever the estimated all-around trade-off is a net positive) productive power for more important tasks. Our cavemen ancestors had few needs but extreme comfort, pleasure and fulfilling lives.<p>As we strayed away from nature, we created all the problems and neuroticism that successive social institutions and cultural innovations respectively try to solve.. Hence, technology, albeit unnatural as far as the normal process of evolution is concerned as it is (arguably) inherently not evil nor bad per se, it is the consequence of the biblical[Fall], and the requirement to undo it is to recreate the Eden that Earth used to be. The most pressing step toward that is attaining total military supremacy to neutralize the enemies of our race and the planet as a whole. Then we will be free to live as pleases our inborn sense of aesthetics, either in spaceships, caverns or trees, or trees in spaceships. This position aligns with

For this reason nuclear energy needs to be curtailed until nuclear waste has found a lasting solution not requiring constant human surveillance.<p>But most importantly the moral and economical issue with nuclear power is the very high technicality involved which is not efficient: the lower the tech level the longer the infrastructure tends to last, Roman roads,aqueducts and medieval houses being prime instances. Complex things break down, this applies to human civilization and institutions as well. Heavier, sturdier materials, however expensive to build, create older cultures putting to shame anything modern aiming at doing similar things.<p>We should build with stones, create new pyramids made of earth brick composite carbon and stainless materials that will last for the millennia to come, invent mechanisms still functioning after centuries of non-maintenance. Houses warming or cooling using natural energies and isolation, <em>mass heat storage</em>, solid foundations still worthy of inhabiting when all the people who built it and their descendants will be long dead.<p>We must develop human (or animal) power using modern materials, and when not possible (or unpractical) seek to do away with any construction. We must learn to limit technology to the barest minimum compatible with a pleasant daily life, and learn to rely once again on human powers - one oneself and each other.<h3 id=into-space class=headings><a href=#into-space>Into space</a></h3><blockquote class=aside><span class=inner-comments tooltip="Personal comment">…

Derailing or disintegrating them from orbit is actually beyond our current capacity.<p>Even our ability to merely <strong>detect</strong> them, recently appeared more illusory than we thought.

Our unique knowledge of it allowed us to come up with a definitive and total theory of education.<br>First we need to explicit a few methodological principles that as a matter of fact, we also always apply everywhere in this website, to determine what <strong>should be</strong> compared to what <strong>is</strong>. Our approach is definitely of the instinctivist kind, predicated on deducing the maximum <q>racial potential</q> from the disparate data of literature and real life.<p class=important>Our <dfn tooltip="The view that human behavior and social adaptation is the resultant of the interplay of various instinctive drives">instinctivist</dfn>
approach postulates that:<ol><li>Any cognitive/personality traits displayed in any given population we deem <em>species-wide capacities</em> with only secondary genetic or individual causality, <em>if and only if</em> it:<ul><li>shows up <em>consistently within a racial stock</em> (between the three major ones) enough not to be a statistical coincidence.<li><em>and</em> can be considered <em>totally positive</em>, <em>an unambiguous quality</em> and not just a neutral idiosyncrasy</ul><li>Such traits within a given <em>pure</em> genetic cluster may be thus be considered <em>the norm for the distant raw Neanderthal forebears</em>.</ol><p>The rationale being, animal psychology stems directly from genetic programming, neatly adapted to its natural environment and bodily constitution (which includes the brain&rsquo;s structures) for more time than we can fathom. Hence humans should not be any different: genetically similar humans diverging too much are the product of unnatural environments and diets, thwarting innate programming. Ergo it is justified to look at the brightest most balanced examples of culturally-stereotypical personalities all along history regardless of their rarity in the grand picture, to deduce what non-degenerate ancestors were like <strong>at minima</strong>.<br>The same principle applies for rare but certain instances of psychic abilities as just like personality, these depend on <strong>highly coadapted gene complexes taking eons to emerge</strong> so can only be thought as <strong>potentials merely wasted</strong> by usually <strong>lacking the proper environment</strong> to manifest.<p>This epistemological aside out of the way, let us just dive straight in: How did the most successful civilizations raise their children ?<p>It is fashionable in <q>spiritual</q> circles, to consider that being certain of something makes you magically wrong regardless of the context, and loses inspiration, and that instead we should encourage children to <q>take nothing for certain</q>, <q>rediscover and learn with them</q>. This is a fallacy, that confuses <strong>efficient pedagogy</strong>, with <strong>epistemology</strong>, the ontology of knowledge.<p>True knowledge isn&rsquo;t relative and up for debate, it is absolute, stemming from a transcendent source. It also stands to reason that some things <strong>need</strong> to be perceived as absolute for psychological reasons. A 7 years-old child isn&rsquo;t meant to question what a 57 years-old man says, or we should wish to reconsider <strong>what kind of society creates such abysmally deficient adults.</strong><br>To encourage this delusion is tantamount to <em>child abuse</em>. Below 10 children are hardwired to seek certain truths to absorb and build their global outlook on the world to become stable, independent persons. Teachers (all adults) should always know on average vastly more than fledglings.<p>Metasexual love opens the mind for a superfast overriding of egotic hesitations while the unfettered fusing of the teacher&rsquo;s and student&rsquo;s mind to share both <q>worldly</q> and extrasensory knowledge. Fragile young people, if exposed too soon to a world of uncertainties, will develop symptoms of schizophrenia. While a lot of what we are taught at any given age is objectively crap and researchers commonly employ an authoritative language disparaging of any alternative <q>fringe</q> point of view (**despite the vast majority of their articles being either disproved, forgotten or superseded in a few years with few persons having read them) it is misguided and wrong to confuse the eager desire to make sense (which should be nurtured at all cost !) with what amounts to <strong>basic distrust of authority</strong> and elders (and leaders), that leftists strive to instill in kids, unless they get in power of course&mldr;<p>The understandable impossibility to immediately grasp the motive behind each and every detail or convention from the get-go, is no reason to reject them immediately and that attitude should not be nurtured. Obviously not every detail has to be presented with an air of religious certitude either but children should be convinced that <strong>fundamentally that a correct understanding of anything is much more likely to mirror the teacher&rsquo;s position, than to a brand new different one</strong>. <q>Truth</q> should be seen as coming from adults.<p>The notion of <q>personal choice</q> is overrated. Choice without prior knowledge is meaningless and leads to both individual failure and social chaos&mldr; both striking as today&rsquo;s norm.<p>The rule should instead align with specializing students according to necessities, economic or scientific, within a reasonable range of estimated compatibility. A partial caste system isn&rsquo;t ruled out with children strongly encouraged to learn specific vocation from their parents and so forth, mating within this trade (hopefully, their own family) throughout their bloodline in hope of maintaining and improving an inborn talent for said profession. Naturally strong love ties between generations more often than not pushes children to gleefully take after their parents or immediate role models.<p>If someone wishes strongly for a specialization not fitting with quotas and social necessities established by committees of experts in the central government (in a truly collectivist fashion !) and/or his natural dispositions determined through comprehensive neuropsychological analysis and more importantly, <strong>visionary means</strong>, then he should be required to pass extensive testing, to ensure adequate motivation as well as discourage people from wasting themselves in an ill-chosen preference (while also avoiding the emergence of cultural stigmas developing around certain professions).<p>Needless to say, unexpected genius for any area (music, painting, particle physics, whatever) developing ahead of schedule with regards to expectations or age shouldn&rsquo;t be ignored, but heartily supervised.<h3 id=outline-of-topics class=headings><a href=#outline-of-topics>Outline of topics</a></h3><p>The bedrock of education between 6 and 10 should be <strong>skills building characters and last a lifetime</strong>. <em>Nothing should be learned to then be forgotten quickly after</em> as in customary today: This centuries-old conception of <q>culture</q> as <q>what is left after forgetting everything</q> is utterly wrong, resulting in an egregious as well as systematic waste of time and attention span of all children up to and including the university level: we should remember everything forever.<p>Primary school (6 to 10) should be dedicated to <strong>extreme psychophysical mastery including meditation and thorough martial training, bare-handed and armed all the same</strong>, <strong>survival skills</strong>, the basis of genetics as it relates to races and an in-depth understanding of functional biology (how bodies work).<p>In the latter years of this primary cycle, the basics of technical science should be introduced.

Then he divides the total by the number of units produced (of shoes, for example). And he writes the quotient on the object indicated. This is the selling price he will ask the buyer.<br>This is how things should reasonably be; and it is quite certain that if this method were always observed, wages would never be compressed and there would be no social or economic crises. Unfortunately, in the system of competition which is the one of the neoliberal economy which governs us, one proceeds exactly in the opposite direction.<p>The selling price is fixed first by the brokers on the national market, without any intervention of the producers, without any consideration of the cost price, by the simple law of supply and demand. If the buyers are the most numerous, the prices rise and all the elements of the cost price are easily covered. But if the sellers prevail, the producer is obliged to lower his selling prices, and if the fall is accentuated and prolonged, he is obliged to compress the elements of his cost price. Starting from the selling price. He then proceeds, not by addition, but by subtraction.<p>From the total sum he has received from his customers, he deducts:<ul><li>The cost of the raw materials he has purchased and whose invoices he cannot change;<li>The distribution costs: transport, brokerage,<br>distribution costs: transport, brokerage, discounts, etc., over which he has no control,<li>The interest and amortization of the sums that he has devoted to the purchase of his machines and various installations:</ul><p>They represent expenses made a long time ago and on which he can no longer return:<ul><li>The general expenses of the company: general administration<br>The general expenses of the company: general administration, rent, taxes, insurance, which he can only slightly modify.<br>In short, there are only two items that can be easily reduced:<li>The profits that he allocates to himself or that he shares with his shareholders (it is understandable that he does not willingly resign himself to reducing them, at least as far as he is concerned);<li>And finally the wages of his workers: he will therefore reduce the price of the hour worked. Then, if this is insufficient, the number of working hours (short-time working). And finally the number of workers employed (total unemployment).</ul><p>In short, in the so-called <q>liberated</q> economy based on the law of supply and demand, it is the selling price that determines the cost price, whereas in good logic <strong>it should be exactly the opposite</strong>. Since the New Reich abandoned gold payments

</span>, it no longer had to take into account price fluctuations on the international markets when setting its domestic prices. It took advantage of this, as we have seen, to quickly raise wages by 20 percent.<br>And since the worker could not (because of rationing) increase his consumption, he used this surplus to pay contributions (compulsory or voluntary) for social insurance, pensions, paid vacations, leisure, sports, etc.<br>Thus was instituted in Germany what could be called the <strong>full wage, covering not only the vital needs of the worker but also the performance bonuses and all the risks of work (accidents, illness, old age, unemployment, leisure, etc.)</strong>. All these charges were incorporated into the wage, which was itself introduced entirely by way of addition into the cost price, which was no longer compressible, since it was removed from international competition because of the <strong>abandonment of the rule of gold</strong>.<p>For nine years, the Reichsbank, freed from the metal cover, has been able to increase or reduce the circulation of its banknotes at will: a dangerous privilege which, if left to the arbitrariness of power, could quickly lead to inflation and ruin. But the government of the New Reich has three manometers at its disposal to regulate its action, constantly adjusted by the services of the Conjecture:<ul><li>The curve of the amount of <strong>bills</strong> issued by the Reichsbank;<li>The curve of the <strong>wages and salaries (consumption)</strong> established each week by the Ministry of Labor, and regularly completed by those of the global incomes of the country;<li>The curve of the <strong>cost of life</strong></ul><p>If the cost of living increases, it is because the purchasing power of the public exceeds the quantities of the objects produced; by reducing the volume of bills in circulation, the volume of purchases decreases: prices tend to fall and the cost of living also decreases.<p>If, as a result, the curve falls below the normal level, the Reichsbank increases the circulation of its banknotes; the purchasing power of the masses rises and the cost of living goes up. By a continuous game of trial and error, by a series of incestuous variations in both directions. The Reichsbank can thus adjust (indirectly) the whole of production to the whole of consumption. Thus, empirically, the Reichsmark has been given a constant value and a fixed ratio between wages and prices, which is the first condition for social peace.</blockquote><cite>Francis Delaisi—La révolution européenne</cite>

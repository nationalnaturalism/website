Even to those with little knowledge of genetics or biology, or perhaps even more importantly to them, as they have not been formatted by the mainstream ideology.<br>Biology, ecology and everything to do with evolution, is filled to the brim with materialistic doctrines of a quasi-religious nature, that don&rsquo;t say their name but camouflage as objective science. The core of this religion, is the belief that evolution (by extension, nature) is purposeless and meaningless, as meaningless as life itself.<br>True science has to be berated, silenced or willfully ignored, and the public, throught the media and school manuals, misinformed and lied to, in order to hide the many facts and discoveries not compatible with the neodarwinist religion that teachers and physicians preach.<p>What I want is to uncover the ideological underpinnings of the modern neo-darwinist synthesis, and provide a comprehensive, all-inclusive alternative that is at once justify a lot if not all of what teach, regards to diet, pathogens and incest. To create that final perspective, to understand natural laws, the only things that were needed, were the intellectual propensity to reject no fact how strange and inconvenient they may be, and think along the lines of reasoning that decades of experience of instinctotherapy and unsurpassed healing proved true.<br>Finally this will also consitute the most thorough and fundamental defense of scientific racism ever produced, and at the end, you shall be privy to a practical plan to bring back our species to the past biological perfection of our ancestors.<h2 id=genetics class=headings><a href=#genetics>Genetics</a></h2><h3 id=basic-background class=headings><a href=#basic-background>Basic background</a></h3><figure><figcaption>Chromosomes</figcaption><a role=presentation target=_blank href=/Images/biology/chromosomes.webp><img src=/Images/biology/chromosomes.webp srcset="/Images/biology/chromosomes.webp 653w, /Images/biology/chromosomes_hu0ce65a0024a694088a46d89f5c432c69_52438_604x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 604w, /Images/biology/chromosomes_hu0ce65a0024a694088a46d89f5c432c69_52438_400x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 400w, /Images/biology/chromosomes_hu0ce65a0024a694088a46d89f5c432c69_52438_200x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 200w" loading=eager fetchpriority=high alt=Chromosomes title=Chromosomes sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, (max-width: 600px) 50vw, 400px" width=653px height=455px style=--height-limit:455px></a></figure><p>Before any knowledge of this process or the molecular basis on genetics could be attained, the monk Gregor Mendel determined purely through experiments and statistics that traits were programmed by a number of genes, distinct units of heredity of which each organism had to carry two instances (<dfn tooltip="Refers to a variant of a gene, resulting from a mutation and hereditary, ensuring the same function as the initial gene but according to its own terms. Any gene can have several alleles, which often determine the appearance of different hereditary characters">alleles</dfn>
) - because peas, his model species, appear to be diploid, but some other plants aren&rsquo;t. And because he saw most traits (not all) to be inherited separately along during crosses, ignorant of the fate of the others, each gene was supposed to segregate <em>independently</em> as if being their own separate molecule. Then some phenotypical (visible) traits would be deemed monogenic if its transmission follow simple laws, thus depending on just one gene, or polygenic if pattens would appear in the segregation of phenotypes, which appeared to reflect that of several genes cooperation to produce an effect.<p>The laws are summarized in <dfn>Mendel&rsquo;s laws of inheritance</dfn><ul><li><dfn tooltip="Some alleles are dominant while others are recessive; an organism with at least one dominant allele will display the effect of the dominant allele.">Law of dominance and uniformity</dfn><li><dfn

cells. Our whole DNA, the vehicle for most of our heredity, is packaged in a set number of 46 pairs of chromosomes (for humans), independent molecules going in pairs of homologues sharing the same structure. During <dfn tooltip="Special type of cell division of germ cells in sexually-reproducing organisms that produces the gametes, such as sperm or egg cells. It involves two rounds of division that ultimately result in four cells with only one copy of each chromosome. Additionally, prior to the division, genetic material from the paternal and maternal copies of each chromosome is crossed over, creating new combinations of code on each chromosome">meiosis</dfn>
, those homologous chromosomes physically bond, exchanging strands along the chromosome&rsquo;s length. Such crossing-overs happen at 7 places on average (over a varying length of DNA and distance from each others) and are responsible for a reshuffling of alleles, their redistribution, leading to the same sequence of genes along the molecules but a different combination of alleles between the two homologues.<p>Then the pair separates and migrate to opposite ends of the nucleus, forming two different gametes whose total DNA is the same as the original cell, but pairs broke up, so each cell keeps only one chromosome thusly one version of each gene. In humans a full <dfn tooltip="Group of specific alleles bundled on the same or different chromosomes, in a single organism">haplotype</dfn>
complement (that of a gamete, spermatozoid or ovule) makes for 23 chromosomes, and fecundation restores the pairs. Genes on the same chromosome, the further they are from one another, the more likely a crossing-over is to take place, shuffling haplotypes of homologous chromosomes, with gametes being as likely to inherit recombinant molecules as if the pair of genes were on separate molecules. Inversely the closer physically, <em>linked</em>, the more likely a particular gene sequence or haplotype is to be passed on unchanged to daughter cells.<p>Of these three laws, only second has stood the test of time, aneuploidy (failures of chromosome pairs to segregate correctly) most often leading to catastrophic failures in development, whatever the organism. As we know now the physical underpinning of heredity the simplistic dichotomy dominant/recessive on the molecular level proved vastly inadequate, arising as an illusion du to the limitation of technical methods of the time of Mendel, until the mid-XIXth century.<p>Despite that in reality most mutations are completely silent, and that effects can arise at many levels, which might or not change the protein, its expression or regulation in any numbers of ways, which might or not impact the phentype. But of all genes, only a fraction produce proteins, while the overwhelming majority of mutant alleles. Early researchers suffered from selective perception (still now&mldr;), often rejecting unconclusive data they could not make sense of yet, in the name of dogmas born from those very limitations, prefering nice consistent (but ultimately false) theories to unclear facts.<p>Mendel only studying simple genetic systems, lead future generations to define genes as mostly protein-producing <dfn tooltip="A locus, as related to genomics, is a physical site or location within a genome, such as a gene or another DNA segment of interest.

with mutations causing different colors sizes or aspects, or obvious failure. We&rsquo;ve learnt since then that the expression of a lot of traits depend of complex pathways and the interactions with a quantity of other molecules, plus the effect of the environment. We know too that there is a (variable) number of steps from transcription to protein modification, with a multitude of interactions at all levels, so that dominance is only a relative notion if most of the time if we look closely, either lies on a scale, in some cases

This mechanism would appear to remediate for the low level of MHC diversity in genetically depauperate population, involving a reshuffling exons while maintening the exclusion from point blank SNPs thus preserving functionality.<p>Given that the process takes at minima a few tens of thousands of years (starting with less than a hundred strong founder population), most likely only in the few rare individuals, the frequency of the mechanism per site and generation must still be extremely rare&mldr; an order of magnitude higher than the expected chance mutation, while significant, is still very low. This could explain the difficulty to see this phenomena in laboratory or other controlled conditions, yet should be added to the three aforementioned classical mechanisms.<p>The difference being, that amped up gene conversions do not involve natural selection, <em>pathogene-mediated or otherwise</em>: While individuals with a renewed MHC repertoire could boast a survival advantage the latter is likely not significant, because the phenomena takes place in the span of millenia, not decades or centuries. Strenghtening <em>the absence of <strong>experimental evidence</strong> for natural selection</em> against pathogens.<p>Explaining this incredible natural polymorphism demands quite a lot intellectual gymnastics, to explain how a supposed strong selection (which pathogens should cause) can coexist with an absence of selective sweeps (the eventual fixation of a beneficial mutation) and thus the maintenance of infrequent alleles, in less than 1% of the population.<p>The ruling opinion dictates that pathogens mutate constantly so that heterozygotes always have an advantage (heterozygote advantage), alleles never have the time to be discarded completely before recovering again some protective value (fluctuating selection) and rarity would hold an intrinsic edge for minor haplotypes as microbes would wouldn&rsquo;t statistically be compelled to adapt to unfrequent alleles, thus keeping the latter both relevant and rare.<p>It all sounds fine and dandy, but proving this model or the prevalence of any one of these mechanisms is impossible to attest or prove, both experimentally<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup> and theoretically<sup id=fnref:3><a href=#fn:3 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>3</a></sup>, thus it it is not a scientific theory but make-believe to maintain the myth of diversity, natural selection and the germ theory. And one should not conclude that cells would somehow keep a record in order to strike something like a &ldquo;golden mean&rdquo; in diversity, this gene conversion actually <em>erased</em> a number of haplotypes in <em>local</em> populations, their number only rising at the <em>metapopulation</em> level.<br>Several arguments in this case serve to discredit against the pathogen-driven selection being behind the usually high number of polymorphisms in the MHC.<ul><li>Firstly, the fact this increase here took 75 000 at minima, implies that the initial low paucity in MHC diversity in this bird population must not have prompted a strong selection pressure or caused significant mortality.<li>Secondly, non-synonymous mutations did not exceed synonymous/neutral ones, a signature usually interpreted as <em>the absence of positive selection</em>. Yes hitchiking could explain that, however<li>this phenomena only shuffled the <em>existing</em>, with no creation of new functional alleles, so that recombinant haplotypes could hardly constitute new effective defenses, which would quickly loose their edge anyway as supposedly pathogens never cease to evolve, and much faster than animals too.<li>75 000 years should be more than enough to overcome a very limited repertoire and we ought to see <em>balancing selection at play</em>, with diversity increasing both globally <em>and</em> locally.</ul><p>What we see instead is a <em>very slow coalescing of an optimal number of semaphores with which to perfect the dialog with the local microbes and parasites</em>. I claim that the best fitting hypothesis for the genetic facts we observe in the MHC, are best explained by vertebrates sharing from time immemorial a symbiotic relationships with all microbes and all parasites, <em>commanding</em> them due to the exponential gap in complexity and adaptive capacity in our immune system.<p>The principle being, that it happens only as a consequence of pollution, or metabolic deficiency leading to waste accumulation and immune functions (meant to keep exogenetic cleaners honest) failing due to old age, signaling to predators and parasites alike which animals to single out, thus keeping populations in optimal health.

Such models can not inform natural situations: these animals are not only very homozygous, but very degenerate too.<p>Assuming no human disturbance or cooking, no evidence of a genuinely adverse relationship has been seen with a natural microbe or parasite, in a natural situation, in Europe or Africa, on people or domestic animals, no any issue with local or exotic food as genetically remote and alien-looking as can be, pointing at the existence of an universal <em>molecular order</em> as old as life itself, explaning for instance how primate palates can enjoy and digest deep sea food, despite their ancestors possibly possibly not tasting them since the first batracian ventured on land.<p>So I supopse that in absence of environmental or <em>dietary</em> pollution <strong>mortal</strong> infections should not follow exposure to new &ldquo;pathogens&rdquo;, when it comes to mammals, reptiles if not fish too. The concept of natural selection (in the strict sense of death and survival of the fittest) by pathogens in the case of higher vertebrates (and a small number of other animals), ultimately derives from the same pasteurian mindset as germ theory itself. We learnt to see only fighting and adversity, when nature has always been all about balance all along.<br>Maybe it is time we accept to revise our deep-seated presuppositions, and see this balance not just as an emergent property of complex ecological systems (species endangering their own long time survival weeding themselves out eventually) as modern ecology theorizes, but as a truly <strong>primary</strong> force ruling shaping genetics and molecular biology with undercurrents actually more fundamental than Darwinian dynamics.<h3 id=quantal-genomics class=headings><a href=#quantal-genomics>Quantal Genomics</a></h3><p>Our DNA has been built over millions of years, forming adapted gene complexes whose unity is crucial to conserve adaptations through

which are the bulk of genetic variation world-wide, show for lots of them if not most, a mutational signature typical of deaminase activity, the main means of DNA/RNA edition at our disposal. That means <em>a significant part of all changes considered so far as random (usually hazardous) could be adaptive innovations</em>, either through the the aforementioned very slow, unreliable change of methylated cytosines, or the fast potent way featured by the somatic hypermutation:<p>Genes transcribed into RNA get holes punched into them with deaminases, holes then filled with faulty polymerases, then the result is retrotranscribed into DNA like viruses do, to replace the old version, with the new mutations. Data suggest, that the <strong>totality of the genome</strong> functional genes RNAs pseudogenes and repeated sequences alike have at some point or another, been subjected to hypermutation.<p>Incidentally, we have known for a long time embryos and gametes, though in theory the most guarded against retrotransposition/integration of foreign genetic material, actually demonstrates the opposite: Mature spermatozoa and early embryos are extremly permeable to foreign DNA and RNA molecules, by design.<blockquote>Retrotransposon-encoded RT is stored in mature gametes, is highly expressed in early embryos and undifferentiated cells, and becomes downregulated in differentiated cells. In turn, RT plays a role in developmental control, as its inhibition arrests developmental progression of early embryos with globally altered transcriptomic profiles. Thus, sperm cells act as recipients, and transgenerational vectors of somatically derived genetic information which they pass to the next generation with the potential to modify the fate of the developing embryos.</blockquote><cite>Corrado Spadafora—Soma to germline inheritance of extrachromosomal genetic information via a LINE-1 reverse transcriptase-based mechanism</cite><p>These mutations would thus affect <strong>all organs</strong>, the muscles, ears, eyes. Not unlike what Frank Herbert described. In this conception of evolution currently work-in-progress, selection still does matter, but its role is limited to sorting out endogenous ordered adaptations, putting to test the product of lives and intelligences.<p>Evolution of this type gives a satisfactory explanation to the enormous complexity of behavioral instincts: Such traits would be lost by mixing with other groups bearing adaptations of their own to wholly different selective pressures, born of different ecologies, social environment and pre-existing racial background. Mating within your family which in all likelihood experienced the same things under the same cognitive constraints, leads also in all likelihood to the same solutions, because your genetics are therefore compatible, essentially doubling down on your adaptation. Thus justifying the ancient practice of hereditary monarchies and noble marriages.<p id=homeostasis>On the theoretical level, the need for a great heterozygosity (both alleles of a pair of chromosomes differing), the greatest genetic variety in order to stay adaptable to a changing environment does not hold up. It is false that a consanguineous species would become uniformly homozygous and vulnerable to environmental changes: These two assumptions are false. In addition, <strong>adaptation to a changing environment is not necessarily based on a heterozygous population</strong><sup id=fnref:9><a href=#fn:9 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>9</a></sup>.<p>But exampls of immediate Lamarck transmissions of relatively complex adaptations of the most impressive kind do exist however<sup id=fnref:10><a href=#fn:10 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>10</a></sup>, proving the potency of mating relatives who shared the same experience at play.

This is a common problem even today when the child happens to bear a different rhesus factor than the mother, leading to <dfn tooltip="The antibodies of a mother sensitized to the Rh factor can cross the placenta and infiltrate the blood of the fetus. These antibodies destroy some of the baby's red blood cells and cause fetal anemia, or Rh disease, in which red blood cells are destroyed faster than the body can replace them.">rejection in utero</dfn>
. However, this doesn&rsquo;t exist with animals, and only happens in a <strong>cooked food setting</strong>. Mr Burger&rsquo;s wife (Nicole Burger) has had this problem, then she ate a ton of chanterelle which <em>completely changed her own rhesus factor blood ratio</em>, and the baby suffered no issue. Something similar could happen in some cases, which would reflect our unnatural diet and not the simple facts of genetics.<p>The second hypothesis, is that this compatibility would be determined at least in part by the affinities in the major histocompatibility complexes, resulting in a closer and active <em>sensitivity to the child&rsquo;s genetic defects</em>, with a greater amount of miscarriages than the normal couples, while in theory, at least in the long run, the <strong>surviving children</strong> would achieve <strong>better health</strong>.<p>The study shows that the effect is correlated with the global matching of MHC I and II, therefore correlated with the <em>intensity of inbreeding</em>, exposing more recessive defects, explaining a higher initial fetal loss. <em>We suppose a joint evolution of the fetus and the mother to favor the best DNA in the interest of the species</em>, is both more logical and congruent with the literature.<p>Moreover a defective individual with reduced reproductive potential (or very shortened lifespan) will be able to multiply more of his DNA through his siblings and healthy parents than himself, in the same way that in eusocial insects (ants, bees, termites&mldr;) workers or non-reproductive castes work for the reproduction of the queen, insofar as her offspring are extremely close genetically (or even clones) of the workers. Thus this higher <em>inclusive fitness</em>&mdash;multiplying one&rsquo;s share of DNA in circulation&mdash;, in accordance with the egoist gene theory, could very well explain in evolutionary terms the participation of the fetus to this active screening at the price of its own survival.<p>So it would not be surprising if we had evolved at the fetal stage the tendency to sacrifice ourselves in case of even minor genetic defects, rather than aggressively clinging to the slightest resource of the mother&rsquo;s body as is claimed today, in pure projection of liberal capitalism on nature. Communist biologists would probably have come to different conclusions.<h4 id=the-power-of-consanguinity class=headings><a href=#the-power-of-consanguinity>The power of Consanguinity</a></h4><p>One finding might suggest a <strong>unique capacity for inbred mammals to either epigenetically compensate for recessives, or even repair their DNA</strong>, depending on the nature of the prior symptoms.<p>A family of triple homogenous <dfn tooltip="A mutation permanently preventing the expression of the gene, by stopping the synthesis of a key protein.">knock-out</dfn>

But then <strong>the symptoms disappeared</strong> and the animals went back *<em>to full health in 2 to 4 generations</em>, leading the researcher to label the phenomenon &ldquo;inbreeding de-repression&rdquo;.<p>The speed of its effect (2 to 4 generations) led them to the conclusion that the symptoms in the first place were not genetic in the first place.

The probability is astronomically low, in fact impossibly low when concerning 3 genes, <strong>progressively</strong> over several generations.<p>But knowing how what original mutation(s) led to the knock-out lines could make a big difference, making such reversion much more likely: Because the term &ldquo;knock-out&rdquo; signifies that protein <em>synthesis</em> is averted, only regulatory regions and/or the initiation codon really need be affected, not the sequence coding for important aminoacids such as those responsible for the folding of the protein, or its catalytic site.

It has been established that more than 70 % of the genetic load is made up of these alleles.

<a href=/en/incest/>consanguinity</a>. Among the same average genepool mating close kin has the automatic effect of heightening variance, depending on the existing allelic diversity. According to fossil Neanderthal DNA our ancestors were a fairly consanguineous bunch, with a fairly high degree of homozygosity or individual uniformity on a chromosomal level, hence while a few heterozygous recessives do not necessarily constitute defects (the resulting trait could be advantageous… theoretically!) our species is not meant to carry a lot of them and most likely not to profit from them either: within a natural mating framework, with the small effective population number that was ours, they could not remain heterozygous for long.<p>So with consanguinity degenerate bloodlines die out (mostly in embryo, or through predation, natural or artificial selection) whereas other survive and become much healthier, purged from the genetic load, minus some loss of diversity and « bad » but not lethal alleles which got fixated.</p><a role=presentation target=_blank href=/Images/memes/meme_pharaos_centuries_of_incest.webp><img src=/Images/memes/meme_pharaos_centuries_of_incest.webp srcset="/Images/memes/meme_pharaos_centuries_of_incest.webp 794w, /Images/memes/meme_pharaos_centuries_of_incest_hua2a46657e5f0428c296e2d707925b81f_462840_604x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 604w, /Images/memes/meme_pharaos_centuries_of_incest_hua2a46657e5f0428c296e2d707925b81f_462840_400x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 400w, /Images/memes/meme_pharaos_centuries_of_incest_hua2a46657e5f0428c296e2d707925b81f_462840_200x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 200w" loading=lazy alt="Meme about centuries of incest among Pharaohs" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, (max-width: 600px) 50vw, 400px" width=794px height=794px style=--height-limit:794px></a><p>Hence once those purified bloodlines have been obtained, it is advantageous to mix them with each others, to increase variance and diversity again, and remove those other bad alleles as well, as each consanguineous line is susceptible to fixate by chance (or genetic drift) a different set of unwanted traits, not present in others.<br>Three factors determines the efficiency of this protocol:<ul><li>The more related parents are the faster recessives show themselves<li>the more offspring such matings produce the more available combinations you produce out of the parents’ genome, out of which a harsher selection can apply to find the ones completely devoid of lethals, hence the healthiest children and so also the least susceptible to fix non-lethals detrimental alleles<li>the more diversity population-wise and more bloodlines subjected to this purification, the further the operation can be carried out and repeated by crossing those lines to concentrate good haplotypes and remove the bad ones through selective breeding.</ul><p>It entails that the ultimate unmasking of alleles would be selfing, as a (very) low number of animals (mostly invertebrates) though a fair proportion of plants do. <strong>Selfing is different from cloning.</strong> <dfn>Cloning</dfn>
consists in the perfect preservation of the parental (maternal) sequence without formation of gametes and recombinations, but that is very rare in vertebrates, and technically difficult to induce as the formation of the first polar body (which sees homologous chromosomes separating) happens very early, and can not be averted. Cloning will require a costly and wasteful lab procedure as long as synthesizing both DNA and gametes is not an option.<br>Beside we desire not perfect copies <em>but the improvement of traits</em>, which requires the recombination of existing alleles.<hr><p>The haploid complement of the second polar body is not exactly identical, since on average one sister chromatid has undergone crossing-overs prior (while the other not), so reuniting them produce (on average) 50% homozygous pairs, not 100%, while the first generation maintains 75% of the maternal information. Also allelic recombination (hence the heterozygous state) is more frequent for some chromosomes than others, and the closer to the centromere. o compare, the offspring of normal sibling (or parent-child) incest is 25% homozygote. Fusing the blastomere on the other hand, guarantees total 100% homozygotes or <em>double haploids</em>.<p><dfn>Selfing</dfn>
on the other hand implies the production of gametes of both sexes within oneself, followed by fertilization. Any one chromosome pair can recombine or not be recombined while in the aforementioned model, one is always recombinant and the other not.<p>Hence selfing produces more varieties to pick from. This, would be the ultimate form of natural incest. One impossible to emulate per se since we cannot produce both gamete types, we are not hermaphrodite snails.<hr><p>Producing ovules out of a man yet (or sperm out of a female, though that would be much easier) is out of the question and with the current craze about transsexuals I hope will stay that way, but inducing gynogenesis (a synonymous of parthenogenesis) is possible through two kinds of chromosomal manipulation, which precipitates in respectively 3-4 generations or just one the genetic result of 12 generations of sibling matings. Gynogenesis is a common feature of reptiles, amphibians and fish, mostly associated with external fertilization.<dl><dt>gynogenesis<dd><blockquote>Gynogenesis is useful for rapid improvement of genetic characters, producing inbred (clonal) lines compared with the traditional methods of sib-mating for up to 10 to 20 generations. Clonal lines are supposed to be very valuable products for improvement of fish stocks. In view of this, meiotic gynogenesis have been produced in many species of fish but are not completely homozygous due to recombination between non-sister chromatids. This occurrence is undoubtedly absent in case of the production of mitotic gynogenotes induced by the suppression of first mitotic cleavage and thereby the progeny are homozygous at every gene locus. Therefore, it is very advantageous for producing clonal lines in the subsequent generation(s) with unique gene combination.</blockquote><cite>—1997, Induction of mitotic and meiotic gynogenesis and production of genetic clones in rohu, Labeo rohita Ham</cite></dl><p>Since the species of interest always require a fake fecundation (without syngamy) to initiate development, gynogenesis always requires sperm sterilized through UV rays. Suppressing the ejection of the second polar body is done through either/or osmotic shock (temporary pressurization) or heat shock.<p>Non-mammalian vertebrates can often be treated like this easily and may do so naturally on a regular basis owning to the frequency of external fertilization, as the very aggressive exterior environment easily provides the shock required to suppress the ejection of the second polar body, which only happens at the very end of fecundation. Inferior vertebrates (not counting birds) also feature more often polyploidy or underwent recently several rounds of entire genome duplication, making their genetics extremely labile, a property also explaining their ease of hybridization.<br>On the other hand, mammals are notably more complicated with all of the above both rare and highly detrimental.

Hard to gauge. While normal incest with sound parents is usually very safe, these protocols we discuss entail from twice to four times the amount of consanguinity of sibling incest in one go, making dead certain to reveal whatever might be hiding in the recesses of your genome. Fish species throughout evolution went through several rounds of entire genome duplications, and some species - like trouts - more recently than others, producing highly redundant gene families, acting in effect as multiple extra alleles, hence in these cases the resilience to higher degrees of homozygosity than customary for us.<p>Even then, fishes respond in a variety of way:<blockquote><p>Consequently, to obtain the sufficient DH genetic materials without reducing reproductivity for many fish species is still an important challenge. In this study, all six gynogenetic fish were successfully induced to produce DH offspring, whereas only one common fish did. In addition, both the CHR and the CNR of the common fish were lower than those of the gynogenetic fish. Induction rates of DH increased with Parental fish homozygosity rising, and a very significant correlation was found. Meiotic gynogenesis could provide an effective means to rapidly obtain homozygotes in fish. As indicated earlier, meiotic gynogenesis is easier to conduct than mitotic gynogenesis.<br>The mean survival rate of offspring produced by mitotic gynogenesis was very poor (4.1%) when compared to meiotic gynogenesis (19.3%) in loach (Arai 2001). Goudie, Simco, Davis and Liu (1995) tried meiotic and mitotic gynogenesis in channel catfish. They documented survival rates at 1.5 months of 2% for meiotic and 0.2% for mitotic gynogenesis. We observed a similar result: the CNRs of C1 and G3 for mitotic gynogenesis were 10.34% and 20.40%, respectively, compared to 48.42% and 57.25% for meiotic gynogenesis.

This phenomenon could be due to a decrease in the number of recessive lethal alleles (Nagy, Rajki, Horvath & Csanyi 1978), because deleterious genes should be eliminated from proximal regions of chromosomes by consecutive meiotic gynogenesis. Therefore, this may be a feasible method to obtain DH genetic materials for flounder.</blockquote><p>This shows the efficacy of the method.

Once we reach total purification down to the ground level of chaotic errors (infinitely small in raw primates, compared to insects or bacteria), how to go further toward full recovery of the Neanderthal phenotype ?<p>Motoo Kimura, a leader of the synthetic theory of evolution and later the neutral theory of molecular evolution (stating that most mutations are synonymous hence neutral and <strong>random</strong> drift being the principal driver of change) said very well:<blockquote><p>Even if in the distant future it will become possible to <strong>freely replace DNA base pairs in the nucleus</strong>, it is <strong>premature</strong> to think that the genetic qualities of the human can be freely improved. This is comparable to the notion that the blueprint for any splendid machine can be drawn provided paper and a pencil are available, and <strong>ignores the higher dimensional problem of information</strong>. Moreover, the conundrum exists of <strong>how far the human can improve its brain by using its brain</strong>.</blockquote><p>Regardless of computers, what does the comprehension in last analysis is always the brain, and nothing ensures our brain can outdo millions of years of evolution nor is designed to understand itself totally. The intellect can not exceed itself by its own means. What Kimura couldn&rsquo;t know is that we don&rsquo;t evolve but devolve, so one simply needs to amplify the ancestral part of us:<br>we don&rsquo;t know why molecularly speaking the past was better, we just know it was from reasoning and looking at bones. And then Lamarckian mechanisms do not require our understanding either, we just need to set up the good conditions for their application.<p>Lastly, the brain does not only possess intellect

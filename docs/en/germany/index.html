You&rsquo;ll find here a cursory exposition of the figures and reasoning. Killing through gas is excruciatingly complex and dangerous for the operators, and even considering the way the crematorium is supposed to have worked, the numbers involved are ludicrous.<p>The figures summoned by a reasonable analysis based on facts unsurprisingly match the curve of episodic diseases, and of the damages caused by war to infrastructures and supply lines, making treatment of said epidemics nigh impossible. Not just internees died… though it is a fact that typhus was an endemic infection in Jewish communities, owing partly to their historical or cultural lack of hygiene and medical care.<p>Germans also possessed large secret stockpiles of before unseen chemical nerve agents (Sarin, Soman, Tabun) that had an exponentially higher lethality rate in much smaller concentrations than the supposed Zyklon B gas (which was a commercial pesticide, widely used in various industries) of which the majority was used in delousing operations even according to official holocaust history.<p>It would therefore make sense for the notoriously efficient Germans to employ these highly lethal chemical weapons on a people they supposedly wanted to genocide instead of an option that was considerably less lethal and inefficient.<br>From the insane literature available on to the physical impossibility of mass gassing it suffices to read the Leuchter Reports:<blockquote><p>Between 1988 and 1991, U.S. expert on execution technologies Fred Leuchter wrote four detailed reports addressing whether the Third Reich operated homicidal gas chambers. The first report on Auschwitz and Majdanek became world famous. Based on chemical analyses and various technical arguments, Leuchter concluded that the locations investigated <q>could not have then been, or now be, utilized or seriously considered to function as execution gas chambers</q>.</blockquote><ul class=center><li><a role=presentation target=_blank href=/Images/nazi_holocaust_weimar_ww2/holocaust_proper/01_dissecting_the_holocaust_auschwitz.webp><img src=/Images/nazi_holocaust_weimar_ww2/holocaust_proper/01_dissecting_the_holocaust_auschwitz_hue2aaf710e1f402781dfc5a50f83b79c9_2066620_800x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp srcset="/Images/nazi_holocaust_weimar_ww2/holocaust_proper/01_dissecting_the_holocaust_auschwitz_hue2aaf710e1f402781dfc5a50f83b79c9_2066620_800x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 800w, /Images/nazi_holocaust_weimar_ww2/holocaust_proper/01_dissecting_the_holocaust_auschwitz_hue2aaf710e1f402781dfc5a50f83b79c9_2066620_604x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 604w, /Images/nazi_holocaust_weimar_ww2/holocaust_proper/01_dissecting_the_holocaust_auschwitz_hue2aaf710e1f402781dfc5a50f83b79c9_2066620_400x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 400w, /Images/nazi_holocaust_weimar_ww2/holocaust_proper/01_dissecting_the_holocaust_auschwitz_hue2aaf710e1f402781dfc5a50f83b79c9_2066620_200x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 200w" loading=lazy alt=01 sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, (max-width: 600px) 50vw, 400px" width=800px height=1201px style=--height-limit:1201px></a><li><a role=presentation target=_blank href=/Images/nazi_holocaust_weimar_ww2/holocaust_proper/16_leuchter_reports_gassings.webp><img src=/Images/nazi_holocaust_weimar_ww2/holocaust_proper/16_leuchter_reports_gassings.webp srcset="/Images/nazi_holocaust_weimar_ww2/holocaust_proper/16_leuchter_reports_gassings.webp 773w, /Images/nazi_holocaust_weimar_ww2/holocaust_proper/16_leuchter_reports_gassings_hu806d2480578dd78f1fcaa86bedf74ad6_752484_604x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 604w, /Images/nazi_holocaust_weimar_ww2/holocaust_proper/16_leuchter_reports_gassings_hu806d2480578dd78f1fcaa86bedf74ad6_752484_400x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 400w, /Images/nazi_holocaust_weimar_ww2/holocaust_proper/16_leuchter_reports_gassings_hu806d2480578dd78f1fcaa86bedf74ad6_752484_200x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 200w" loading=lazy alt=16 sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, (max-width: 600px) 50vw, 400px" width=773px height=1159px style=--height-limit:1159px></a><li><a role=presentation target=_blank href=/Images/nazi_holocaust_weimar_ww2/holocaust_proper/14_auschwitz_plain_facts.webp><img src=/Images/nazi_holocaust_weimar_ww2/holocaust_proper/14_auschwitz_plain_facts.webp srcset="/Images/nazi_holocaust_weimar_ww2/holocaust_proper/14_auschwitz_plain_facts.webp 752w, /Images/nazi_holocaust_weimar_ww2/holocaust_proper/14_auschwitz_plain_facts_hudad9c6217cdb6b0db05e50e7dad32f40_722246_604x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 604w, /Images/nazi_holocaust_weimar_ww2/holocaust_proper/14_auschwitz_plain_facts_hudad9c6217cdb6b0db05e50e7dad32f40_722246_400x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 400w, /Images/nazi_holocaust_weimar_ww2/holocaust_proper/14_auschwitz_plain_facts_hudad9c6217cdb6b0db05e50e7dad32f40_722246_200x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 200w" loading=lazy alt=14 sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, (max-width: 600px) 50vw, 400px" width=752px height=1129px style=--height-limit:1129px></a><li><a role=presentation target=_blank href=/Images/nazi_holocaust_weimar_ww2/holocaust_proper/02_auswchitz_ziklon_lie.webp><img src=/Images/nazi_holocaust_weimar_ww2/holocaust_proper/02_auswchitz_ziklon_lie_huba23842e0beb23c9877a29547bf8fd34_1638970_800x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp srcset="/Images/nazi_holocaust_weimar_ww2/holocaust_proper/02_auswchitz_ziklon_lie_huba23842e0beb23c9877a29547bf8fd34_1638970_800x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 800w, /Images/nazi_holocaust_weimar_ww2/holocaust_proper/02_auswchitz_ziklon_lie_huba23842e0beb23c9877a29547bf8fd34_1638970_604x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 604w, /Images/nazi_holocaust_weimar_ww2/holocaust_proper/02_auswchitz_ziklon_lie_huba23842e0beb23c9877a29547bf8fd34_1638970_400x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 400w, /Images/nazi_holocaust_weimar_ww2/holocaust_proper/02_auswchitz_ziklon_lie_huba23842e0beb23c9877a29547bf8fd34_1638970_200x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 200w" loading=lazy alt=02 sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, (max-width: 600px) 50vw, 400px" width=800px height=1200px style=--height-limit:1200px></a></ul><p>Executing by gas today, requires a prison to empty an <strong>two</strong> entire floors of its inmates, by precaution.

To find the references of each statement, please refer to this book available on the internet for free, and see for yourself how those words come from Nazi themselves interviewed during the Nuremberg trials.<br>During the six years of peace that the Third Reich was granted, the concentration camps had no economic significance. Their purpose was to isolate habitual criminals, as well as opponents of the regime who were considered incorrigible, from the general population, and to reform those regarded as re-educable to become good citizens in the spirit of National Socialist ideology.<p>In pre-war times the number of concentration camp inmates was relatively small; in the summer of 1937, for example, the population of all concentration camps, including the criminals and the <q>anti-socials</q> (vagrants, beggars etc.), totaled 7,500.<br>After the war broke out, more and more concentration camps were set up and the number of inmates skyrocketed. The war brought an internationalization of the camps; aside from resistance fighters from the nations under German occupation, ever-increasing numbers of prisoners-of-war were also committed, and as of 1941 numerous Jews also joined the inmate population.<p>Constantly more Germans were called to fight at the front as the war dragged on. Manpower shortages became a problem of paramount importance for the economy of the Third Reich. This resulted in a change of the concentration camps’ function. The re-education function was pushed into the background, and the economic aspect grew in importance.<p>On April 30, 1942, SS-Obergruppenführer Oswald Pohl, Chief of the <abbr tooltip="Wirtschaftsverwaltungshauptamt, the SS Economic-Administrative Main Office" role=term>WVHA</abbr>, wrote to the Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler:<blockquote>The war has brought a visible change in the structure of the concentration camps and has fundamentally altered their responsibilities with regard to the use to which the inmates may be put. The detention of inmates solely for security, educational or preventive reasons is no longer in the fore. Emphasis has shifted to economic concerns. Mobilizing all inmate labor, first of all for war-related tasks (increased armaments production) and later on for tasks of peacetime, is becoming more and more important.<br>This realization results in certain necessary measures requiring a gradual restructuring of the concentration camps from their former, one-sidedly political form into an organization appropriate to the economic tasks.</blockquote><p>Jews in particular were detailed to work in the camps. In a letter to SS-Gruppenführer Richard Glücks, the inspector of the concentration camps, Himmler stated in late January 1942:<blockquote><p>Be prepared to admit 100,000 male Jews and up to 50,000 Jewesses into the concentration camps in the next four weeks. Great economic orders and tasks will be put to the concentration camps in the next weeks.</blockquote><p>A wealth of documents demonstrates the role of the Jews in the National Socialist war economy. On May 11, 1944, for example, Adolf Hitler personally ordered 200,000 Jews employed within the framework of the Fighter Plane Construction Program Of course the extremely high death rates in the camps, resulting primarily from diseases but also from inadequate rations and clothing as well as from overwork, detracted severely from the economic efficiency of the camps. For this reason, Richard Glücks sent a circular to all concentration camp commandants on December 28, 1942, making them personally responsible for maintaining the inmates in a work-fit condition. Glücks wrote:<blockquote><p>The First Camp Physicians are to use all means at their disposal to effect a considerable decrease in the mortality figures in the individual camps
<span class=inner-comments tooltip="Personal comment">…
</span>. The camp physicians are to pay greater attention to the inmates’ rations than heretofore, and shall submit proposals for improvements to the camp commandant, in agreement with the administration. These improvements must not remain on paper only, but must be regularly verified by the camp physicians. Further, the camp physicians shall see to it that working conditions at the various work sites are improved as much as possible
<span class=inner-comments tooltip="Personal comment">…

The Reichsführer-SS has ordered that mortality absolutely must decrease.</blockquote><p>In fact, this order did result in a very considerable improvement in the conditions in most camps, and mortality decreased by almost 80% within eight months. Aside from the economic significance of inmate labor to the Third Reich, security considerations were the second most important reason for the expansion and consolidation of the concentration camp system. In many occupied nations the Germans found themselves faced with resistance movements, and responded with throwing people in camps. Armed resistance was particularly powerful in Poland, and most especially in the vicinity of the city Lublin.<p>A Polish source comments:<blockquote><p>As of early 1942 a partisan movement also began, within the framework of which some 20,000 armed soldiers from various underground organizations fought in 1944 in several dozen partisan units.<br><span class=inner-comments tooltip="Personal comment">…

Even though the occupiers combated the resistance movement with the most drastic of measures (pacification, burning of villages, executions, deportations etc.), they failed to bring the situation under control. We shall only point out that, according to German sources, no fewer than 27,250 ‘attacks’ of various kinds were committed in the territory of the

Lucas details the damage inflicted on the Germans by the Polish resistance as follows:<blockquote><p>I&rsquo;ll include only the most striking:<ul class=col_2><li>Locomotives damaged 6,930<li>Trains derailed 732<li>Railroad cars destroyed 979<li>Disruptions of electric power in Warsaw 638<li>Military vehicles damaged or destroyed 4,326<li>Tons of gasoline destroyed 4,674<li>Oil refineries incapacitated 3<li>Military warehouses burned 122<li>Factories burned 15<li>Defective parts for aircraft engines produced 4,710<li>Defective cannon barrels produced 203<li>Defective artillery shells produced 92,000<li>Defective aircraft produced 107<li>Defective parts produced for electrical appliances 570,000<li>Important plant machinery damaged 2,872<li>Various acts of sabotage 25,145<li>Attacks on Germans 5,733</ul></blockquote><p>General Eduard Bor-Komorowski, the leader of the 1944 Warsaw Uprising (who, after being taken prisoner, was well treated on the personal order of Adolf Hitler, and survived the war), commented on this listing as follows:<blockquote>This summary gives only the more characteristic acts of sabotage and is only half the picture of the scope of our activities.<br>These activities of the armed resistance resulted in ever harsher and more extensive reprisals against the civilian population: not only people suspected of co-operating with the partisans, but hostages as well, were arrested en masse and sent to the concentration camps. In that context also occurred the actions or exactions of the Einsatzgruppen on the East front, pacifying occupied territories, a task made impossible by the communist partisan elements, hidden among the population and terrorizing her.</blockquote><a role=presentation target=_blank href=/Images/nazi_holocaust_weimar_ww2/holocaust_proper/39_einsatzgruppen_east.webp><img src=/Images/nazi_holocaust_weimar_ww2/holocaust_proper/39_einsatzgruppen_east.webp srcset="/Images/nazi_holocaust_weimar_ww2/holocaust_proper/39_einsatzgruppen_east.webp 721w, /Images/nazi_holocaust_weimar_ww2/holocaust_proper/39_einsatzgruppen_east_hub6fc886bb303150174f8bda44af1239e_655580_604x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 604w, /Images/nazi_holocaust_weimar_ww2/holocaust_proper/39_einsatzgruppen_east_hub6fc886bb303150174f8bda44af1239e_655580_400x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 400w, /Images/nazi_holocaust_weimar_ww2/holocaust_proper/39_einsatzgruppen_east_hub6fc886bb303150174f8bda44af1239e_655580_200x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 200w" loading=lazy alt=39_einsatzgruppen sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, (max-width: 600px) 50vw, 400px" width=721px height=1082px style=--height-limit:1082px></a><p>As a general rule civilian populations (including Jews) were taken care of politely, but those who rebelled, took part in terrorism, or helped communists while hiding among civilians… were <strong>not</strong> left off the hook easily. This led in the East to wholesale massacres, but again, not without reason and motivation. Yet many resented these orders to <strong>pacify</strong> territories by any means necessary, getting legit PTSD from the experience.<p>The moral dilemma was: kill 5 persons to take one communist out. 4 useless deaths. Though some were likely to know things but refuse to collaborate. On the other hand that single terrorist would go one to kill tens of soldiers, ruin vehicles, planes or whatever, and worst of all, deal strategic blows to the war efforts, indirectly killing many more soldiers and civilians. The choice was quick to make. This was reality, and not the ideal dream world our hypocritical righteous politicians fancy, while carrying equally lethal strikes on countries far away but this time much less justifications.<p>Germans reasoned from an utilitarian standpoint, with good intentions and foresight: how do I minimize the death toll ? And you lack the resources and time to either lock people up or educate them out of their cultural stupidity, hatred and hostile ideology, you have no choice than to kill whole families, children along with their terrorist children… squashing the seed before it grows deep roots. However this was but a small portion of the Einsatzgruppen&rsquo;s role, which was to pacify, including by revitalizing local cultures previously violently repressed by the Communist regime.

It was distinctly felt as undeserved, when weighed against the service of the Jewish community in favor of the wider community, to the folk. They also identified as a nation, both abroad and in Germany, calling for terrorist attacks and a world war against Germany before it even began. In those conditions the concentration of Jews in ghettos was both legitimate and legal, and has been done by Americans for citizens of Japanese origin. Expulsing individuals pertaining to an enemy nationality as a safety measure, also abides to legality.<p>Jews had an incredibly subversive influence on German society in general, as jews that found

To give historical background to an often misrepresented and propagandized subject we shall first start with Hitler’s initial opinions on the Polish nation. Hitler was a genuine big admirer of the Polish marshal Jozef Pilsudski who was a big hero of the Polish-Soviet war that saved Poland and in turn much of eastern Europe from Bolshevik rule with his brilliant military leadership.<br>Hitler had grand plans to work with the Polish government under the Marshal’s leadership, and was very enthusiastic about the future of Polish-German relations. Big plans were put in place, Hitler hoped to have Poland as an ally in its Bolshevik crusade that it was planning to undertake in order to rid the continent of Communism.<br>However all those plans fell apart with the death of the Marshal in 1935. Hitler was deeply distraught by this event and in fact held a large memorial service for the late Marshal, he expressed his deepest condolences to the Polish government and the Marshal’s beloved wife.<p>But the scoundrels did not wait long following the death of the Marshal, and before long the so called <em>loyal student</em> of Pilsudski - Jozef Beck, Polish minister of foreign affairs (Culprit of all the troubles), strayed from his master’s leadership and assumed a very aggressive and hostile stance towards Germany, he believed that Poland could conquer Germany and Berlin within 2 weeks if war was to ever start, and he held this delusional belief that the Germany army was a <em>paper tiger</em> with only 9 divisions (the restrictions imposed upon Germany according to the Versailles treaty), a belief which he mistakenly held all the way up to 1939, and which was indeed a factor that led to the escalation of hostilities.<p>This man was very self-centered and egotistic and for this reason alone he was disliked by many other foreign governments, not just the German one, for instance during a visit to France he was outraged that the French foreign minister didn’t greet him properly during his visit. In April of 1939 he met with Joachim Ribbentrop in a meeting which would seal the fate of Poland.

Nevertheless, the fate of Poland was from this point onwards set in stone.<p>Little known to Hitler was the fact that the large German minority of Poland living in past Prussian territories was facing the utmost oppression even before the outbreak of hostilities, which would only escalate with the Bromberg massacres, a senseless genocide of the native Germans living in Poland at the hands of Polish authorities. This alongside all the above mentioned factors perfectly justified the German invasion of Poland as there was truly no other possible option to avoid this inevitable conflict, at least from the German position.

I will put references about that (about Jews) at a later point.<p>The alleged Hitlerite gas chambers and the alleged genocide of the Jews constitute one and the same historical lie, which made possible a gigantic financial-political fraud, the principal beneficiaries of which are the State of Israel and international Zionism, and whose principal victims are the German people - but not their leaders - and the entire Palestinian people.<h2 id=homosexuals-and-unfits class=headings><a href=#homosexuals-and-unfits>homosexuals and unfits</a></h2><h3 id=about-the-alleged-castrations class=headings><a href=#about-the-alleged-castrations>About the alleged castrations</a></h3><p>Contrary to popular myths, Germans did not kill homosexuals in mass, or castrated them. That applies to all racially unfits and disabled people.

The patient was told &ldquo;that there would be no deleterious consequences.&rdquo; Police force was often needed to bring the patient to the operating table. The operation itself consisted of ligation of the Fallopian tubes in women and a vasectomy for men.</blockquote><cite>—<a href=https://www.thoughtco.com/sterilization-in-nazi-germany-1779677 rel="external nofollow" target=_blank>Sterilization in Nazi Germany</a></cite><p>Here too, Hitler did nothing wrong: they protected the people&rsquo;s genetic legacy with minimal to absent effect on individuals&rsquo; lives. To sterilize any criminal whatsoever is a justified act to preserve the Völk&rsquo;s genepool, and doesn&rsquo;t trouble one&rsquo;s sexual life, nor even the possibility of raising a family (not for criminals obviously), as adoption was highly praised as a moral duty.<p>The same text goes like this:<blockquote><p>Klara Nowak, a German nurse and activist who led the League of Victims of Compulsory Sterilization and Euthanasia after the war, had herself been forcibly sterilized in 1941. In a 1991 interview, she described what effects the operation still had on her life.<p><q>Well, I still have many complaints as a result of it. There were complications with every operation I have had since. I had to take early retirement at the age of fifty-two—and the psychological pressure has always remained. When nowadays my neighbors, older ladies, tell me about their grandchildren and great-grandchildren, this hurts bitterly, because I do not have any children or grandchildren, because I am on my own, and I have to cope without anyone&rsquo;s help.</q></blockquote><p>Here&rsquo;s an obvious case of confirmation bias.

One self-reported and self-diagnosed name for this affliction is post-sterilization syndrome. However, neither experts nor the women who experience discomfort after their sterilization surgery agree on the symptoms of this syndrome.</blockquote><dt>Changes in menstrual patterns<dd><blockquote><p>Some women report changes in their menstrual patterns after sterilization surgery. When researchers compared the changes in menstrual patterns of women who had undergone sterilization surgery with those who had not, there were no significant differences between the groups. It just happens to be that your menstrual flow and duration – and even the pain from menstruation – can change during your lifetime.</blockquote></dl><p>There are also <strong>no documented changes in sex drive</strong> after receiving sterilization surgery. Many women find sex more enjoyable after getting sterilized because they don’t need to worry about getting pregnant anymore.<p>There is no known correlation between weight loss, weight gain, or appetite, and sterilization methods such as tubal ligation. Because of the age bias, doctors mostly offer sterilization to older women—while young women often have tremendous difficulties finding a helpful doctor. Since many people gain weight as they age, they might assume that it’s caused by their sterilization even though there are other factors at play.<p>There have been

A small number were sent to prison according to the law, and a fraction of these were sojourned in concentration camps, where they worked, and enjoyed life conditions identical to those of any other category. To be honest, when we know that Auschwitz had schools, swimming pools, orchestras&mldr;<p>I now even doubt homosexuals were &ldquo;singled out&rdquo;, &ldquo;beaten up&rdquo; or any of that kind of treatment. Simply put, in normal conditions (so maybe not when not everyone is starving or being bombed to death), Germans are human and treat people well, to the limit of their capability. The same was related to prisoners of wars and Jews, both who arguably had quite a lot of reasons to objectively fear Germans.<p>Hence, We now think homos didn&rsquo;t have it much worse than anyone in camps..<blockquote cite=https://www.cwporter.com/homo.htm>First, estimates of the numbers of deaths of gays seems to have steadily grown with time. It would appear that as the story of a Nazi extermination of homosexuals was repeatedly told, the myth took on a life of its own.<br>Secondly, these claims of hundreds of thousands of deaths did not appear before 1973. While a number of books on the Nazi era were written before 1973 mention the incarceration of homosexuals in concentration camps, most accounts known to this author do not make any accusations of extermination.<br><span class=inner-comments tooltip="Personal comment">…
</span>To begin to determine true figures for homosexual arrests and incarceration in concentration camps it is essential to look at the official records of the Third Reich.<br><span class=inner-comments tooltip="Personal comment">…
</span>These figures total 54,330. Estimates of 50,000 to 63,000 convictions from 1933-1944 for homosexuality are accepted by serious researchers on the subject. Only a small percentage of these men were sent to concentration camps after serving their prison terms.Obviously, if less than 63,000 Germans were sentenced to prison for homosexuality, figures of hundreds of thousands of deaths in the concentration camps are impossible exaggerations.<br><span class=inner-comments tooltip="Personal comment">…
</span>The research by Dr. Rüdiger Lautmann is extremely significant and was published in Frankfurt, Germany in 1977 and appeared as an article in English in 1980 (11). Based on his research at the International Red Cross Tracing Service in Arolsen, Hessen, Dr. Lautmann estimated: “The total number of officially-defined homosexual prisoners ever incarcerated in the camps was about 10,000 (but it could be as low as 5,000 or as high as 15,000)”.<br>Ten thousand homosexual prisoners sentenced to concentration camps are approximately 18% of the 54,330 men who served prison time. Thus it can be seen that only a small number of homosexuals who were convicted in the courts were taken into protective custody and sent to concentration camps.<br><span class=inner-comments tooltip="Personal comment">…
</span>Repeat offenders, transvestites and male prostitutes were most likely sent to concentration camps after serving their prison sentences. In fact, Lautmann’s study estimated that 86% of men sent to concentration camps for homosexuality had previously been convicted for sexual crimes of a homosexual nature.<br><span class=inner-comments tooltip="Personal comment">…
</span>Therefore, the average death rate over twelve years for homosexuals who were put in concentration camps is undoubtedly far less than Lautmann’s estimate of 60%. Nevertheless these mortality figures are a serious matter. The concentration camps were obviously dangerous places for homosexuals.</blockquote><cite>Carles W. Porter—<a href=https://www.cwporter.com/homo.htm rel="external nofollow" target=_blank>The Myth of a Nazi Extermination of Homosexuals</a></cite><blockquote><strong>Yet it cannot be claimed that these men were murdered</strong>. The vast majority of these deaths were probably caused by typhus. The suffering and death caused by this disease is well documented by German and Allied sources.
<span class=inner-comments tooltip="Personal comment">…</span><br>The Germans used Zyklon-B to disinfect clothing, bedding and buildings in an attempt to contain the epidemics. Typhus was not eliminated in Europe until the introduction of DDT and other powerful insecticides which were developed by American chemical companies at the end of the war.<br>Particularly absurd are claims that homosexuals were marched into gas chambers. <strong>Assertions that concentration camps had homicidal gas chambers have been proven to be false</strong>.</blockquote><p>On a last note, it was common knowledge that most homosexuals, were also communist antifascist. Enemies of the State, not unlike Jews. On the other hand, We find troubling that that those figures were <strong>so low</strong>:<br>The authorities, Himmler in particular, had access to much more names than a mere 50 000. In a speech to SS Group Leaders, delivered on 18 February 1937, he said:<blockquote><p>When we seized power in 1933, we also found that homosexual organizations were in existence. Their registered membership was over two million; cautious estimates compiled by the officers handling the case suggest that there may be between two and four million homosexuals in Germany. Personally, I don’t set the figure that high because I don’t believe that everyone involved in these organizations was actually homosexual. On the other hand, I am of course convinced that not all homosexuals were registered members of those organizations. My guess is <strong>between one and two million</strong>. But one million is really the bar minimum we can assume; that is the absolute minimum and most conservative estimate permissible in this matter.<p><span class=inner-comments tooltip="Personal comment">…
</span>So that means that there are approximately twenty million men in their reproductive years (men over the age of sixteen). This figure might be off by a million or so, but that is irrelevant.<p>Assuming that one to two million of these men are homosexuals, the result is that 7 to 8 percent of men in Germany are homosexual. which funnily enough, is the proportion of <strong>self-identifying</strong> homosexuals <strong>today</strong>, so this seems credible.</blockquote><p>It doesn&rsquo;t make a lot of sense for there to be at least one million homos yet only&mldr; 0.05 % percent actually sent to jail ? The SS (in Schwarze Korps) abounded in death threats against homosexuals. Yet it didn&rsquo;t amount to much !<p class=important>Let us not mix up propaganda and reality.<p>What motivated Germans, was to destroy effeminate faggots, and we can argue that the overwhelming majority of these convicts were of that kind&mldr; probably not the militarist, masculine kind. Himmler said at least one case of homosexuality was found in the SS per month. How much condemnations or merely accusations, is hard if perhaps to know, but we do know that evading these accusations was often as simple as demonstrating his virility by being married or having kids.<br>Himmler himself defended a lot of victims of accusations: what could it mean ?<p>It meant Nazi fought against effeminate men, seen as a danger to the State. Lacking the concepts to make sense of reality, people raised in a certain culture will be inflicted by an incapacity to verbalize what they live, even to think about it. The same would happen with trying to name various colors within a very limited vocabulary, or differentiating new phonemes in a foreign language: phonemic deafness often takes a time to overcome, and rewire your brain sufficiently to learn to decode perceptions as distinct. Raw perception and its representation in the mental space, depending on the sense, aren&rsquo;t always easy to decouple.<h2 id=conclusion class=headings><a href=#conclusion>conclusion</a></h2><p>More than a crash course, this was rather a guideline of what are called revisionist studies. You may ask <q>why believe them rather than what I&rsquo;ve been told in school ?</q> That is a legitimate question, yet ill-formulated.

All those well-written technical books are all fully sourced, based on contemporary documents mostly available by everyone.<p>Upholding the memory of Nazi Germany is necessary for two reasons: first because tens of millions of lives have been sacrificed on the altar of the second world war, the biggest conflict having ever occurred… So there&rsquo;s likely to be boundless consequences on our lifestyle cultures etc ?<p>Secondly, and more importantly, we value evolution, human or animal biodiversity, especially as new discoveries and our peculiar experiences allow for a revolution, on the likes of the invention of the wheel, or agriculture. A change in perspective so radical it would change forever our ways of thinking.

We, on the other hand, understood. All this, accounting for the inordinate place this author takes in our thoughts.<blockquote><ul><li>Then if this be the nature of love, can you tell me further, she said, <strong>What is the manner of the pursuit? What are they doing who show all this eagerness and heat which is called love? And what is the object which they have in view?</strong> Answer me.<li>Nay, Diotima, I replied, if I had known, I should not have wondered at your wisdom, nor should I have come to learn from you about this very matter. Well, she said, <strong>I will teach you:-The object which they have in view is birth in beauty, whether of body or soul.</strong> I do not understand you, I said; the oracle requires an explanation.<li>I will make my meaning dearer, she replied. I mean to say that all men are bringing to the birth in their bodies and in their souls. <strong>There is a certain age at which human nature is desirous of procreation-procreation which must be in beauty and not in deformity; and this procreation is the union of man and woman</strong>, and is a divine thing; for conception and generation are an immortal principle in the mortal creature, and in the inharmonious they can never be. But the deformed is always inharmonious with the divine, and the beautiful harmonious. Beauty, then, is the destiny or goddess of parturition who presides at birth, and therefore, when approaching beauty, the conceiving power is propitious, and diffusive, and benign, and begets and bears fruit: at the sight of ugliness she frowns and contracts and has a sense of pain, and turns away, and shrivels up, and not without a pang refrains from conception. And this is the reason why, when the hour of conception arrives, and the teeming nature is full, there is such a flutter and ecstasy about beauty whose approach is the alleviation of the pain of travail. For love, Socrates, is not, as you imagine, the love of the beautiful only.<li>What then?<li>The love of generation and of birth in beauty.<li>Yes, I said.<li>Yes, indeed, she replied. <strong>But why of generation? Because to the mortal creature, generation is a sort of eternity and immortality, she replied; and if, as has been already admitted, love is of the everlasting possession of the good, all men will necessarily desire immortality together with good: Wherefore love is of immortality.</strong><br><span class=inner-comments tooltip="Personal comment">…</span><li>I want a teacher; tell me then the cause of this and of the other mysteries of love.<li>Marvel not, she said, if you believe that love is of the immortal, as we have several times acknowledged; for here again, and on the same principle too, <strong>the mortal nature is seeking as far as is possible to be everlasting and immortal: and this is only to be attained by generation, because generation always leaves behind a new existence in the place of the old.</strong>
<span class=inner-comments tooltip="Personal comment">…</span><br>For what is implied in the word <q>recollection</q> but the departure of knowledge, which is ever being forgotten, and is renewed and preserved by recollection, and appears to be the same although in reality new, according to that law of succession by which all mortal things are preserved, not absolutely the same, but by substitution, the old worn-out mortality leaving another new and similar existence behind unlike the divine, which is always the same and not another? And in this way, <strong>Socrates, the mortal body, or mortal anything, partakes of immortality; but the immortal in another way. Marvel not then at the love which all men have of their offspring; for that universal love and interest is for the sake of immortality</strong>.</ul></blockquote><cite>Plato—Symposium</cite><blockquote><p>This was a fake form of immortality, still prone to eternal change and decay, barely an approximation of the true one, the immortality of the soul, mostly carried by inspired, pederastic relationships (I prefer this term as even
<a href=/#girl_sodomy>Greeks would see more to it than &ldquo;homosexuality&rdquo;</a>:<p>I was astonished at her words, and said:<ul><li>Is this really true, O thou wise Diotima?"</ul><p>And she answered with all the authority of an accomplished sophist:<ul><li>Of that, Socrates, you may be assured; think only of the ambition of men, and you will wonder at the senselessness of their ways, <strong>unless you consider how they are stirred by the love of an immortality of fame. They are ready to run all risks greater far than they would have for their children, and to spend money and undergo any sort of toil, and even to die, for the sake of leaving behind them a name which shall be eternal.</strong> Do you imagine that Alcestis would have died to save Admetus, or Achilles to avenge Patroclus, or your own Codrus in order to preserve the kingdom for his sons, if they had not imagined that the memory of their virtues, which still survives among us, would be immortal? Nay, she said, I am persuaded that <strong>all men do all things</strong>, and the better they are the more they do them, in hope of the glorious fame of immortal virtue; <strong>for they desire the immortal</strong>.</ul></blockquote><p id=diotime>The two kinds of love, though not really incompatible - all Greeks had a wife - do not compare in their effectiveness. Breeding is an inferior kind of love as the children of the body die while the children of the soul go on forever, alive in the minds of everyone thousands of years after world-wide, long past the boundary or life expectancy of one&rsquo;s bloodline.<blockquote><ul><li><em>Those who are pregnant in the body only, betake themselves to women and beget children</em> - this is the character of their love; their offspring, as they hope, will preserve their memory and give them the blessedness and immortality which they desire in the future. But souls which are pregnant-for there certainly are men who are more creative in their souls than in their bodies, conceiving that which is proper for the soul to conceive or contain.<li>And what are these conceptions?<li>Wisdom and virtue in general. And such creators are poets and all artists who are deserving of the name inventor. <strong>But the greatest and fairest sort of wisdom by far is that which is concerned with the ordering of states and families</strong>, and which is called temperance and justice. And <strong>he who in youth has the seed of these implanted in him and is himself inspired, when he comes to maturity desires to beget and generate</strong>. He wanders about seeking beauty that he may beget offspring-for in deformity he will beget nothing-and <strong>naturally embraces the beautiful rather than the deformed body; above all when he finds fair and noble and well-nurtured soul</strong>, <em><strong>he embraces the two in one person</strong></em>, and <em>to such an one he is full of speech about virtue and the nature and pursuits of a <em>good man</em>; and he tries to educate him</em>; and at the touch of the beautiful which is ever present to his memory, even when absent, he brings forth that which he had conceived long before, and in company with him tends that which he brings forth; and <strong>they are married by a far nearer tie and have a closer friendship than those who beget mortal children, for the children who are their common offspring are fairer and more immortal</strong>. Who, when he thinks of Homer and Hesiod and other great poets, would not rather have their children than ordinary human ones? Who would not emulate them in the creation of children such as theirs, which have preserved their memory and given them everlasting glory? Or who would not have such children as Lycurgus left behind him to be the saviors, not only of Lacedaemon, but of Hellas, as one may say? There is Solon, too, who is the revered father of Athenian laws; and many others there are in many other places, both among hellenes and barbarians, <strong>who have given to the world many noble works, and have been the parents of virtue of every kind; and many temples have been raised in their honor for the sake of children such as theirs; which were never raised in honor of any one, for the sake of his mortal children</strong>.</ul></blockquote><p>At last, Plato lays out what this way of love actually look like, on a social level:<blockquote><p><strong>For he who would proceed aright in this matter should begin in youth to visit beautiful forms</strong>; and first, if he be <strong>guided by his instructor aright, to love one such form only</strong> - out of that he should create fair thoughts; and <strong>soon he will himself perceive that the beauty of one form is akin to the beauty of another; and then if beauty of form in general is his pursuit, how foolish would he be not to recognize that the beauty in every form is the same!</strong><p>And when he perceives this he will abate his violent love of the one, which he will despise and deem a small thing, and <strong>will become a lover of all beautiful forms</strong>; in the <strong>next stage he will consider that the beauty of the mind is more honorable than the beauty of the outward form. So that if a virtuous soul have but a little comeliness, he will be content to love and tend him</strong>, and will search out and bring to the birth thoughts which may improve the young, <strong>until he is compelled to contemplate and see the beauty of institutions and laws, and to understand that the beauty of them all is of one family, and that personal beauty is a trifle; and after laws and institutions he will go on to the sciences</strong>, that he may see their beauty, being not like a servant in love with the beauty of one youth or man or institution, himself a slave mean and narrow-minded, but drawing towards and contemplating the vast sea of beauty, he will create many fair and noble thoughts and notions in boundless love of wisdom; until on that shore he grows and waxes strong, and at last the vision is revealed to him of a single science, which is the science of beauty everywhere. To this I will proceed; please to give me your very best attention:</blockquote><cite>—idem</cite><p>The following resumes the whole exposition: from one beautiful body to many, from one beautiful soul to many, then to divine essence beauty itself. The text is clear in its inclusion of sexuality. But love of physical beauty (the violent passion for one body) <em>is but one step, a means to connect on a deeper level than just the body or the emotion.</em> That last subtlety, I think, has gone above the head of most readers (even very intelligent ones) so far. Individual passions in general do not matter.<blockquote><p>He who from these ascending under the influence of true love, begins to perceive that beauty is not far from the end. And the true order of going, or being led by another, to the things of love, is to <strong>begin from the beauties of earth and mount upwards for the sake of that other beauty, using these as steps only, and from one going on to two, and from two to all fair forms, and from fair forms to fair practices, and from fair practices to fair notions, until from fair notions he arrives at the notion of absolute beauty, and at last knows what the essence of beauty is. This, my dear Socrates, said the stranger of Mantineia, is that life above all others which man should live, in the contemplation of beauty absolute</strong></blockquote><p>How anyone, even pederasts, can conclude Socrates thought sex as <q>lowly</q> or unfit from this same dialog, will always leave me aghast.<p>Pretty much the same discourse occurs in <em>Phaedrus</em>, a pederastic relationship should not be used for sexual pleasure but to reach the divine. <em>He also ridicules the notion that an adequate lover should have no feelings</em>&mldr; <strong>Nowhere</strong> does he criticize sex in itself.<p>Yet it became mainstream to say this:<blockquote>Notably, Socrates sees the pederastic relationship as ideally devoid of sexual consummation; rather than being used for sexual pleasure, the relationship is a form of divine madness, helping both lover and beloved to grow and reach the divine.</blockquote><cite>—Wikipedia</cite><p>They argue like this:<blockquote><p>And yet, this is tempered in various ways; role reversals between lover and beloved are constant, as they are in the Symposium. Socrates, ostensibly the lover, exhorts Phaedrus to lead the way at various times, and the dialogue ends with Socrates and Phaedrus leaving as &ldquo;friends&rdquo;: equals, rather than partaking in the lover/beloved relationship inherent in Greek pederasty. In the beginning, they sit themselves under a chaste tree, which is precisely what its name suggests—often known as &ldquo;monk&rsquo;s pepper&rdquo;, it was used by monks to decrease sexual urges and is believed to be an antaphrodisiac.</blockquote><p>Socrates here promotes a more appeased approach not consumed by <strong>passion</strong>, touchings are not the issue, they should be an ornament to something that goes deeper. As a divine madness what we do when possessed by love is beyond good and evil, otherwise to suggest it is bad per se would amount to blasphemy, even though Plato constantly talks of being willing slaves of the gods.<p>Now onto Republic, his.<blockquote>It&rsquo;s contrary to nature</blockquote><cite>Plato—Republic, 636c</cite><p>First off, this is wrong, there is no 636c in Republic, which ends at 621d. Hence the criminally stupid author of that hateful claim, should be given the choice of dying mauled by a tiger or crushed by raging elephants&mldr; That quote is from <em>Laws</em>, to which we will come afterwards.<blockquote><ul><li>Can you tell of a greater or keener pleasure than the one connected with sex?<li>I can’t, he said, nor a madder one either.<li>Is the naturally right kind of love to love in a moderate and musical way what’s orderly and fine?<li>Quite so, he said.<li>Nothing that’s mad or akin to licentiousness must approach the right kind of love?<li>No, it must&rsquo;t.<li>Then this pleasure mustn’t approach love, and lover and boy who love and are loved in the right way mustn’t be partner to it?b<li>By Zeus, no, Socrates, he said, this pleasure certainly mustn’t approach love.</ul></blockquote><cite>—Republic, 404</cite><p>Plato is literally proposing the end of all sexual pleasure whatsoever. Anything moving spirits even slightly above the normal should be forbidden, until we all become perfect philosopher <strong>robots</strong>. This was written at most in 375 BCE according to criticisms while <em>Symposium</em> was written between 385 to 370 at the earliest. And it&rsquo;s nothing compared to <em>Laws</em>, the most loathed of his works.<br><em>Those two works contradict each other</em>. One talks of divine folly and uranian <strong>desire</strong> growing the wings of the soul, developing extrasensory perception, political and artistic qualities, when the other <strong>bans</strong> all desire and pleasure. There is nothing grand, nothing inspired nor making much sense in <em>Republic</em> anymore, hardly anything a man of reason would consider neither realistic nor desirable, such as the proposition to cut any and all family ties, not knowing one&rsquo;s relatives in order to identify to the whole community. The idea of regimenting every single aspect of life, stifling and drying up any possible source of creativity. Yet, as this chart below shows, this work came before the development of the Academy ?<p>Why would Plato teach something already completely at odds with its former works, both in tone and content ? What was he even teaching, what have people like Aristotle come to believe as the true doctrine of their master, accessing divinity through mystical pederastic sex ?<p>Or being scared of losing your marbles with any strong human feeling and avoiding any human experiences and connections, including with your family to live like an abstinent Christian monk (even monks might have had homosexuality running high in their convent) ? How did his students react, or the people at large ? If people didn&rsquo;t understand anything (most of them surely didn&rsquo;t), why was the point of running his Academy for years until his death ? <em>None of it makes sense</em>, except believing he lost faith in everything he held dear before. What could have changed him if he did change, is unknown. In Athens, he experienced the rule of the 30, an oligarchic clique put in charge of Athens by Sparta after its victory. They tried to seduce Plato and Socrates, given both were sympathizers of Lacedemon. But to know what exactly happened with the Thirty is difficult to say the least.<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup><p>Then he had a bad experience with Denys 1er de Syracuse, tyrant de Sicile, in 387, which invited him to then dismiss him in the most arbitrary manner, even (as the tradition goes) being responsible for his capture as a slave (fortunately a short experience).

But what he criticizes in this excerpt is obvious: the absence of self-control, effectively giving the man&rsquo;s impulses lowly animal traits. A man should be the object of admiration from his loved one, show the way to virtue, not beg for approval like a faggot&mldr; or a female. <strong>This had nothing to do with homosexuality per se.</strong> Here&rsquo;s another such quote, from Xenophon&rsquo;s symposium seemingly relating the same events:<blockquote><ul><li>Now, whether there is one Aphrodite or two, <q>Heavenly</q> and <q>Vulgar</q>, I do not know; for even Zeus, though considered one and the same, yet has many by-names. I do know, however, that in the case of Aphrodite there are separate altars and temples for the two, and also rituals, those of the <q>Vulgar</q> Aphrodite excelling in looseness, those of the <q>Heavenly</q> in chastity. One might conjecture, also, that different types of love come from the different sources, carnal love from the <q>Vulgar</q> Aphrodite, and from the <q>Heavenly</q> spiritual love, love of friendship and of noble conduct. That is the sort of love, Callias, that seems to have you in its grip. I infer this from the noble nature of the one you love and because I see that you include his father in your meetings with him. <em>For the virtuous lover does not make any of these matters a secret from the father of his beloved</em>.<li>Marry, quoth Hermogenes, you arouse my admiration in numerous ways, Socrates, but now more than ever, because in the very act of flattering Callias you are in fact educating him to conform to the ideal.<li>True, he replied; and to add to his pleasure, I wish to bear testimony to him that spiritual love is far superior to carnal.</ul></blockquote><p>There is no reason to believe Callias would refrain from intercourse, as both love are written as <em>έρως</em>, sexual desire. This notion of two Aphrodites and the term describing the good pederasty (<em>uranian</em> έρως) is the exact same found in Plato&rsquo;s Symposium, while the vulgar (<em>pandemonian</em> Aphrodite) is a mindless form of desire personified by&mldr; prostitutes and married women. <em>Carnal</em> doesn&rsquo;t mean physical, but <strong>only or mainly</strong> lying in the physical.<br>The difference between Plato and Xenophon, really appeared to be minimal on this topic. That coincides with Athenians father both protecting their boys and prompting them to attract <strong>proper</strong> men.<p>The main romantic interest of <strong>most</strong> men (not all, obviously) were (pre)/adolescent boys, because younger children on many levels have no defined gender before puberty kicks in. That moment at the onset of puberty is <em>the last moment to initiate a child and develop the metapsychical program, or else breeding (with or without contraception) becomes the dominant sensibility</em>, and the child loses track of his destiny for good. At least it is the case now, but before age seven&mdash;the age of reason&mdash;kids would stay with women, then in many primitive societies boys would integrate into the men&rsquo; group. So in Sparta for boys the agoge or formal educational system started at 7 while girls usually stayed with the women&rsquo; group. <strong>Nowhere</strong> has Xenophon in whole literary corpus ever emitted any criticism of pederasty.<sup id=fnref:5><a href=#fn:5 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>5</a></sup><h4 id=alexander-the-great class=headings><a href=#alexander-the-great>Alexander the Great</a></h4><p>How is <strong>this</strong> <strong>not</strong> gay ?<blockquote>When he reached the royal palace of Gedrosia, Alexander once again gave the army some recreation by arranging a festival.

Plutarch has argued that Alexander&rsquo;s love of males took an ethical approach, inspired by the teachings of his mentor, Aristotle. He gives several examples of Alexander&rsquo;s morality in this domain:<blockquote><p>When Philoxenus, the leader of the seashore, wrote to Alexander that there was a youth in Ionia whose beauty has yet to be seen and asked him in a letter if he (Alexander) would like him (the boy) to be sent over, he (Alexander) responded in a strict and disgusted manner: You are the most hideous and malign of all men, have you ever seen me involved in such dirty (sexual) work that you found the urge to flatter me with such <strong>hedonistic</strong> business ?</blockquote><p>Plutarch also wrote:<blockquote><p>When Philoxenus, the commander of his forces on the seaboard, wrote that there was with him a certain Theodorus of Tarentum, who had two youths of surpassing <em>beauty to sell</em>, and inquired whether Alexander would buy them, Alexander was incensed, and cried out many times to his friends, asking them what shameful thing Philoxenus had ever seen in him that he should spend his time in making <em>such disgraceful proposals</em>.</blockquote><p>Plutarch&rsquo;s claims of Alexanders moral approach towards sexual relations also extended to prisoners of war:<blockquote><p>But as for the other captive women, seeing that they were surpassingly stately and beautiful, he merely said jestingly that ancient Persians were mysteriously beautiful beings. He describes the Persian women as torments to the eyes. And displaying in rivalry with their fair looks the beauty of his own sobriety and self-control, he passed them by as though they were lifeless images for display.</blockquote><p>The above quotations would be in line with the thoughts laid about before him by Aristotle, <em>who regarded relationships based <strong>purely on carnal relations</strong> to be shameful</em>. Not wanting to use captured prisoners as sex slaves would rather show Alexander&rsquo;s general disinterest in these women. Alexander did however keep a beautiful Persian boy in his stable of lovers.</blockquote><cite>—<a href=https://www.indiaforums.com/forum/topic/4986747 rel="external nofollow" target=_blank>Personal relationships of Alexander the Great</a></cite><h4 id=aristophanes class=headings><a href=#aristophanes>Aristophanes</a></h4><blockquote>They are given to unnatural lust.</blockquote><cite>Aristophanes—Thesmophoriazusae</cite><p>Well those words are not present in my translation. The term <q>unnatural</q> didn&rsquo;t exist, and the its concept just alluded to in <em>Laws</em>. While the idea of a natural order exists, to label people as <em>wicked</em> from deviancy alone regardless of actual harm to society or individuals, was simply a level of normativity non-existent before Judeo-christianity.<br>However, Aristophanes was a notorious opponent of pederasty, who built his fame by making his public of tens of thousands of well-bred Athenian males of all ages laugh, by accusing them of what a lot of <em>adult</em> men were complicit in the passive role. Homosexuality by default implied a sodomy, which requires a passive partner, but both partners would be free citizens. So supposing public morale usually looked down upon passivity, <em>this couldn&rsquo;t possibly a monolithic judgment, as all adult men doing the sodomizing by default had been <q>tutored</q> by an adult man while younger, and thus, <strong>penetrated</strong>.</em><br>In Greek and even more Roman society the distinction between effeminacy and passivity has always been vague, I would argue properly <em>schizophrenic</em>. I would argue the more cooking developed and the less grip public institutions had on the collective, the more the ambiguity would take hold.

But, I think, so long as the boy is not his own master and is as yet unable to discern who is a genuine friend, and who is not, the law teaches the lover self-control, and makes him defer the words of friendship till the other is older and has reached years of discretion; but to follow after the boy and to watch over him the lawgiver regarded as the best possible safeguard and protection for chastity.</blockquote><cite>Aeschines—Against Timarchus</cite><p>Aeschines describes himself as a lover, in this context a <strong>pederast</strong>, and that it is honorable, and says that slaves - people who do not own themselves hence can&rsquo;t be relied on nor be expected to act honorably - can not free men for that love can not be free.

</span>… <strong>and, we might add, female sexuality in males</strong>. Because in some people those things arise from their nature, in others from habituation, i.e. when they’re trained into them from childhood. So in all cases where the cause is their nature, nobody would speak of them ‘not being able to control’ [those urges] (just as you wouldn’t say women ‘lack self-control’ for having the non-penetrative role sexually), and the same goes for any pathological states that result from habituation.</blockquote><cite>Aristotle—Nicomachean ethics</cite><p>He thus equates being penetrated anally (which was but a part of male-male sexuality, even though a good one) with either a deviation from nature or something bred by habit. In both cases putting in the same category as biting your nail or eating charcoal (which is actually healthy), things devoid of moral taint and not really bothersome either. I defer to the translator&rsquo;s note:<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Female sexuality in males&rdquo;: The manuscript text here contains an ungrammatical fragment, usually loosely rendered as ‘sex with men’.<p class=important>It can only mean that in <strong>pig-Greek</strong>.<p>Greek attitudes to homosexuality were complex. Many cities, including Athens, tolerated relationships between an older ‘lover’ (the erastes) and younger, late-adolescent ‘boyfriend’ (the paidika or erōmenos). [A] discusses those relationships as if they were commonplace and normal (see e.g. VIII.4 and IX.1). But the relationships had rules: the younger men were not expected to stay in them into manhood. Also, the younger man – who played the quasi-feminine role – <em>was supposed to be the sexually passive partner</em>. Older men who were passive sexual partners (in that sense) throughout their lives were considered unusual, and teased with accusations of ‘effeminacy’ and ‘softness’. (There are various graphic terms of abuse for men known for having those tastes, preserved by Aristophanes.)<br>Given these cultural facts, and the physiologically explicit remark about women that follows, and [A]’s attitudes elsewhere, we can be certain that he was not referring here to homosexuality in general or to the cultural practice of the erastes/erōmenos relationship in general (‘pederasty’, as R wrongly translates), but to sexual passivity (i.e. a preference for being penetrated) in (older) men.<p>Victorian scholars, because of their own attitudes, took A’s phrase ‘outside the bounds of being a bad person’ (which means ‘something it makes no sense to regard as morally bad’) to mean ‘beyond depraved’, i.e. unspeakably evil – <em>pretty much the exact opposite of its actual sense</em>. Note that A says that God is outside the bounds of badness, too, at 1145a26.<br>[A]’s treatment in fact has elements of defense. Some men have female sexual tastes, he says, and it makes no more sense to criticize them for those, or accuse them of ‘not controlling themselves’, than it does to criticize women for the same. And notice that he appears to place such tastes on a moral par with biting your fingernails and pregnancy cravings.<br>A key Peripatetic text to compare here is Problems 879a36. There the question is raised, ‘Why do some men enjoy the passive sexual role?’ There is no hint of condemnation. But A – or whoever the author is – does say, as here, that the natural version of the condition is a ‘physical impairment’ that ‘distorts’ reproductive functioning. The terms are biological, not moral.</blockquote><p>For Aristotle, not really the most spiritually aware Greek author, being the bottom did raise some suspicion of effeminacy but was not strictly equivalent to effeminacy, or <q>female sexuality in men</q>, or it would have been call <strong>faggots</strong> a whole lot of old(er) well-bred men. Again, sexuality was a trivial matter in Greece, <em>you could do mostly whatever you wanted with however, as long as you didn&rsquo;t touch the property of others</em>. Even touching your relatives was strictly speaking your business, with only consequence at worst as far as literary records are concerned, was eventually being kicked out of a few social circles. Simply put, not all faggots are passive, and not all men who enjoy passivity are faggots. Now, or back then, and while they lacked the psychoanalytic tools to discern with exact accuracy, the ambiguity featured in literature attests of such an unconscious knowledge. <em>Even here Aristotle does not insinuate such men with <q>female sexuality</q> have moral issues, lack courage or virility in life etc</em>.<p>Also Aristotle:<blockquote><p>Why is it that some men enjoy being the passive partner in the sexual act, and some of these also find pleasure in taking an active role, but others do not? <em>Those in whom the semen travels to the anus desire to be passive in the sexual act, those in whom the semen travels to both places to be both active and passive. In whichever place there is more fluid they desire more friction</em>. In some men this disposition arises from habit. For men do whatever happens to bring them pleasure and they emit semen following the same principle. Therefore, they desire to do those things through which this is brought to pass, and it is rather as though habit becomes nature. On account of this, whoever has not been accustomed to be a passive partner in sexual intercourse before puberty, but starts around puberty, because memory is generated during the activity and pleasure comes along with the memory, on account of their habit they desire to be the passive partner as if they were naturally so constituted-frequency and habit bringing it about just as if they were naturally so inclined. If a man happens to be lustful and self-indulgent each of these comes about more quickly.</blockquote><p>As the archetypal rationalist, he ridicules himself by coming up with a mechanical explanation. But he does not make any assumption as to the moral characters of individuals based on sexual proclivities, stating that any disposition whatsoever with some training and willingness to explore oneself (a natural character trait he labels <em>lustful</em>). But while he assumes the only role of semen or ejaculation is fecundation hence such biological disposition appear contradictory to natural order, it is never said to go against <em>natural</em> proclivities in the sense of causing diseases or damaging bodily function. One can simply be or become that way, almost by chance. And elsewhere he describes pederasty as socially useful and ethically valuable&mldr; Not so reactionary !<h3 id=conclusion class=headings><a href=#conclusion>Conclusion</a></h3><p>While not denying a certain reality, the famous Roman hate for sexual passivity is both misunderstood and exaggerated. Surely enough, Romans were too hasty in associating effeminacy with passivity, it wasn&rsquo;t unconditional either. Individuals of high stature whose virility lied beyond any doubt, could afford being both feminine and masculine. <strong>Truth be told</strong>, effeminate gays do indeed make for the bulk of homosexuals today, so the association isn&rsquo;t (and wasn&rsquo;t) entirely fortuitous or mean. But neither homosexuality nor passive sodomy was ever forbidden, and barely frowned upon. Until Christianity took over.<br>The confusion between two programs always existed, and all social measures when it comes to mores express an unconscious or conscious will to protect transcendance, however misguided our perception of it may be. In the Quran, adultery is defined by a penetration (in another&rsquo;s man&rsquo;s wife) <em>longer than the time to boil an egg</em>. Which is to say, there was no adultery if the man didn&rsquo;t ejaculate. Our interpretation of all of ethnology and history should be revisited with the two instinctive programs of love in mind. We need to rethink our whole literature.<p>Overall, Greeks (and Romans)&rsquo; attitude resonates with a divide between <em>porneia</em> and <em>eros</em>, or we would say in more modern terms, concupiscence/lust compared to <strong>metasexuality</strong> or spiritual love. Temperance is not <em>not continence</em>, just like being willing to test and raise one&rsquo;s pain threshold is not torture, as long we don&rsquo;t push it too far. Pleasure is enjoyed and desires are difficult to overcome because they abide by one&rsquo;s nature, while pain and tests of all kinds are not enjoyable, because they go against natural proclivities.<blockquote>Is it not worth mentioning his self-control in erotic matters if for no other reason than one&rsquo;s amazement at it? One would say that his holding off from those he did not desire was merely the act of an ordinary human. <em>But he loved Megabates, the son of Spithridates, just as the most intense character would love <strong>the most beautiful boy</strong></em>.</blockquote><cite>Plutarch—Lycurgus</cite><p>The two Symposium do not actually differ so much: both pitting an <q>Uranian <strong>Eros</strong></q> versus a <q>lowly</q> desire content to satisfy itself with any <strong>body</strong>, be it a prostitute, an animal or worse&mldr; a wife. Among proponents of the latter were some Cynics, since their whole shtick was to shock society <em>systematically</em> by whatever means, for ill or good. Hence attacking pederasty as unnatural (bad), while question the taboo of incest (good) and cannibalism (?!). They aligned themselves with animal life&mldr; But that of lowly dogs and cows, not apes.<h2 id=degenerate-homosexuality class=headings><a href=#degenerate-homosexuality>Degenerate homosexuality</a></h2><h3 id=anti-sodomy-laws class=headings><a href=#anti-sodomy-laws>Anti-sodomy laws</a></h3><p>Lastly when it comes to historical evidences, of course the absence of homophobic punishment should be considered <em>at minima</em> evidence of the freedom to have homosexual relationships. But on the other hand, anyone familiar the Middle-East, the Maghreb or medieval history would say remark, that the presence of anti-homophobic laws is <em>the evidence of nothing</em>, if not a mildly negative general sentiment of some sort, in some regard, by some parts of the population, which still indulge in sodomy or whatever else anyway. One has to attest to prosecutions and execution of sentences, to prove anything. Today, a law is only worth its application, however casual.<p>Let us take two exemples, among the most extreme, <em>verbally that is</em>: the Sassanid Persians and the Jews, both sharing a properly metaphysical abhorrence of sodomy (either hetero&mdash;&ldquo;incomplete&rdquo; sodomy&mdash;or homo).<p>In the first case erected as the evil cosmological opposite of swedodah, incest, equally powerful but in the service of Ahriman (their Satan).

More could be said about the true meaning of these laws, but it suffices to consider them as Excalibur impulses, unconscious reactions to the general degeneracy of any sexuality under cooking conditions, and usually (regardless of the textual violence and threats of eternal damnation) aimed at <strong>correcting</strong> behaviors. On top of that, because all sexuality degenerates, phenomenons like scapegoating take hold.<p>But first, let us explained the true degeneracy of the mental disease known as <em>faggotry</em>: the dietary and psychoanalytical reason why effeminate men exist, have existed probably since cooking itself but have only now not only taken the spotlight, but truly become the dominant type among homosexuals. There are several factors, in the genesis of the faggot or effeminate personality, to be sorted in two categories:<ul><li>Upbringing<li>Endogenous influences, aka <em>primary masochism</em>" and denatured molecules.</ul><h3 id=exogenous-influences class=headings><a href=#exogenous-influences>Exogenous influences</a></h3><p>For the most part, bar from congenital anomalies (which is unlikely in our case as effeminacy has occurred consistently throughout history, signifying un inborn potential for it) abnormal personality developments (relative to genetic data) is always due to wrong upbringing with a wrong education and/or wrong role models. In cultures denying the spiritual and marked by the reproductive instinctive program on overdrive due to cooking, there the very conceptual framework to understand sacred or true homosexuality properly if at all, is jarringly lacking.<p>The only conceptual framework to make sense of love is breeding, one male and one female about the same age, to make kids raise them and look after them then make more and repeat. Well, granted nowadays kids learn about <em><strong>some</strong></em> other models increasingly early. But none of them can hope to compete with mainstream ideas as <strong>logical</strong> the equation sex = reproduction remains intact as the perceived natural norm: Some people being allowed to differ if they feel like it, doesn&rsquo;t stop them from being deviants. Still in the early 2000 it was unknown in the wider public (and refused by most primatologists) that bonobos were highly homosexual, let alone the myriad of other species added to the

In that context only reproductive intercourses makes sense logically.<br>This is a splendid example of conceptual blindness, low-key dominant for centuries of Christianity. While the Industrial Revolution (for reasons we&rsquo;ll dwell on another time) erected it as an absolute uncontested religion enforced by moralists and physicians, bringing all the Heaven down on Earth and substituting God with Matter.<p>The result, is the association of socially-induced feeling of sickness or shame with natural homosexual desire, a state of mind which, since energy deal with the <strong>very purpose of existence</strong>&mldr; is bound to backfire horribly.<p>Due to shame, the stronger the homosexual drive (with frustration) the stronger one feels compelled to reject it in all kinds of ways expounded by Freudian psychoanalysis. Some double down on the hetero model by lying to themselves and masquerading as the most rabid homophobes, while others instead seek to ape women in mannerisms through transgenderism or effeminacy to justify their &ldquo;perversion&rdquo; in a kind of fake heterosexuality. Wading in self-contradiction, they wish to appease both their own conscience and their natural metasexual needs, a tension yielding more shame and ulterior degeneracy now driven by self-hatred.<br>Those types of men (barring the unfortunate victims of propaganda) have recently taken the next logical step inaugurated in the West by

Consequently, our position, which is essentially open to both sexes, deserves to be called that.<br>But this amalgam is nevertheless based on a certain reality <strong>of a symbolic order</strong>: for a long time it was less easy to project on the pederast the appearance of the predator, than on the heterosexual pederast (male, of course), unconsciously accused <strong>of making a mistake in the plan and projecting the woman onto the child, thus seeking to live the relationship on a very degrading and, it must be said, traumatic level</strong>.<p>Feeling the tide turning, many (the majority) of homosexuals chose social conformity, molding themselves into the conventions in the hope of being accepted. Philosophers felt it coming:<blockquote>At the beginning of the homosexual movement the thing did not make a problem. But today
<span class=inner-comments tooltip="Personal comment">[ - 1982 - ]
</span>, some homosexuals who are looking for a quick social integration in the society want to ignore the question of pedophilia, which is top embarrassing in their eyes.

In the end though, they are victims of a system denying the very meaning of existence for which they craved enough to forfeit their humanity. <strong>A poor education and/or subpar intelligence conjugated with industrial food, and the crazy high mental feedback level did the rest.</strong><p>This was for the exogenous, social influence, the socially-induced or <em>secondary guilt</em>. Freud on the other hand speculated the existence of an inborn or primary guiltiness, innately bound to sexuality and related to a <q>death drive</q>, as a natural counter-weight to Eros, the pleasure principle.<h3 id=primary class=headings><a href=#primary>Endogenous masochism</a></h3><p>Obviously analysts and moralists rushed to abuse this concept, to rationalize their sadomasochistic practices for repression and self-inflicted suffering as natural&mldr; I whip myself so I am. No joke, Freud&rsquo;s orthodox successors went that far down the rabbit hole.<p>Howbeit, formulated as he did the notion of <strong>primary masochism</strong> doesn&rsquo;t have to imply a (phylo)genetic or hereditary etiology,though he did favor such an explanation&mldr; Or rather, lest for ditching it completely We do not believe neither him nor anyone of the time could have made sense of this intuition in any other way. They needed the experience of <strong>raw food</strong>.<p>Primary means <q>not learned through interaction with other people</q> but there is another source of behavioral denaturation: cooked food.<p>Cooking-induced feedbacks alter brain functioning and heighten three essential cognitive tendencies up to pathological proportions, as described by Mr Burger: psychosis, schizoid dissociation and paranoia (or egotism). We shall defer to his books for more details, but we&rsquo;ll stick with paranoia for a bit, for it lies at the core of the whole failure of modern sexuality, and its incapacity to reach its natural transcendent purpose, even in seemingly <strong><em>kosher</em></strong> relationships such homosexual or Greek-style pedophiliac ones.<p>Paranoia, as he defined, is the innate tendency to be convinced of something regardless of evidence or logical inference. Or maybe, the ability to continue in a given direction in absence of immediate verification or gratification, until the task&rsquo;s fulfillment. In itself, there is nothing wrong with this, hence I used the word <q>ability</q>: all animals are capable to some degree of postponing satisfaction while holding on to a behavior. Going further, no situation in life is ever totally, absolutely certain: not even the sun rising again tomorrow. We create absolutes out of habit and convenience, but such worldviews really are products of repeated experience.<p>However, what we mundanely label as paranoia (or ego) is the certitude of being right despite conspicuous evidence of the contrary, and the incapacity or stern refusal to even consider alternative points of view. And by evidence, I mean failing at the stock exchange five times in a row yet still persisting and losing thousands in a laughably terrible move while lashing out at all in an attempt to dissuade him and blaming others for one&rsquo;s own mistake&mldr; Or marrying two times only slightly smarter (but evil) depraved foreign women for their vaginas, and loosing not thousands but <strong>hundreds</strong> of thousands, falling for the very same obvious (well, not to him !) traps. Add both feats to the same individual and you get the spitting image of low-IQ paranoia not even raw food could cure.<p>As cartoonish (though real) this example may be, paranoia though isn&rsquo;t limited to clinical morons, it takes so varied cultured or widespread shapes we don&rsquo;t notice it until it&rsquo;s gone, in either cultural institutions or one&rsquo;s own personality.<p>Feedback coupled with the endogenous over-excitation of cooking also produces, results in a strong tendency to repeat and latch on any source of strong physical pleasure of a rather coarse kind. This focalisation and fixation paranoid on physical sensations itself, is the number one cause of the metapsychic failure of the quasi-totality of relationships regardless of sexual orientation.<p>In these conditions maintaining the proper inner attitude conducive for the emergence of paranormal abilities of any kind, is impossible with cooking for 99% of people in Ancient Greece&mldr; and 99.99% today.<p>Even with the best spiritual and meditative efforts, this endogenous excitation of molecular origin disrupts the most sensitive cognitive processes dealing with energy, disrupting the very calm and receptivity necessary. Normative heterosexuality is much worse in every way conceivable, no question asked, but parapsychic achievements of the kind we observe, have been impossible but for the smallest fraction of the population since time immemorial.<p>Though Greeks had respect and a modicum of understanding for sacred love, how many Socrates and Plato among them ? Even Aristotle, the latter&rsquo;s most brilliant disciple (arguably, lover), grasped <strong>none of it whatsoever</strong>.<p>And to put things in context we&rsquo;ve just discussed highly evolved subtle people for which the baseness or sheer lack of aesthetics of half the current homo population (lesbians fare better) would appear thoroughly incomprehensible, and utterly disgusting. What hope then, does the common drug-filled or condom-worshiping gay have to get telepathy ?<p>Lastly, cooking also specifically physiologically amps up breeding impulses causing what we call a transpulsional induction entailing the confusion of objects of one instinctive program for the closely related pattern in the other program&mldr; People just can&rsquo;t help but play out the reproductive instinctive pattern in their head and life and <strong><em>feel</em></strong> jealousy, possessivity and nesting (investing on material possessions, a nice house etc) as innate.<p>These low quality homos while much nicer, less frustrated than heteros and not losing all their energy in the Wound in the Force that are vaginas, deep down are actually heterosexuals in disguise, treating butts like vaginas. Some very real energy is invested in the wrong channels, desecrating the most revered instrument of divine knowledge with a vile quest for personal enjoyment (or equally lowly very feminine sentimentalism).<p>For fake homos, no heaven or life after death, no more than more normies. And no wonder, those types are the ones begging for tolerance and crying. They are equal to normal couples&mldr;. Because they are. Or worse.<p>And top it all&mldr; such heavy misdirection of instincts, isn&rsquo;t missed out, for it is never a gratuitous choice to miss the most important part of life. Angry as all hell, the subconscious generates endogenous feelings of guilt and inadequacy (which we can not decode conceptually), soon turning into inner distress through compulsion as they are not heeded as should be the case in nature, finally warping personality under ever more unbearable weights of unexpressed self-loathing negativity. This represents Freud&rsquo;s not-so-primary <strong>primary masochism</strong>.<br>And this closes our exposé of the ontology of effeminate homosexuality, or all uninspired homosexualities for the matter.<h2 id=society class=headings><a href=#society>Society</a></h2><h3 id=the-führerprinzip class=headings><a href=#the-führerprinzip>The Führerprinzip</a></h3><p>As we wander streets on any day, we see weak, spineless men controlled by their wives, exuding no virility or sense of confidence.

Hedonism, degeneracy and weakness of character - as demonstrated by the chore of videos of women raped or people beaten up in the subway by subhumans with no one bating an eye - all stem from the absence of moral character, that our model of education totally neglects. But going about this education would require a complete overhaul of sexuality, in particular with children. <em>Greek pederasty</em> (the alliance of tough love and disinhibited sexuality in its vertical component) creates the strongest children, free from doubt and fixations, able to face the hardships of life and the tasks demanded of them by society (for good or bad) We need to rethink the way we educate children, how love, pedagogy, authority and discipline relate to each other.<p>Europeans need the character to trust entirely those with the most inspiration in hope to approach their divinity.

In those situations we act like computers and do not feel much if any effort, merely the physical tension of investing attention, and even this is proportional how much we&rsquo;re used to the task.<p>But things are different whenever we need to <strong>learn</strong>, change our ways, develop totally new skill sets out of sheer grit or merely function beyond our ordinary, physical capacities.

Yes, women tend to revolve around the relational (taking care of others, community building) and men around making stuff (the material) and exploration.<br>Nevertheless specifics are so variable divergent depending on the specific culture, that dwelling on this or building an ontology or a cosmology around yin and yang, Mars and Venus or whatnot is utterly pointless, and anyone older than 20 with eyes to see, should have met enough diverging characters in both sexes to be convinced of the same.<p>The greatest divide between sexes seems to have been the neolithic revolution, with the advent of agriculture and complexification (and ossification) of society. Hunter-gatherer societies appear quite egalitarians, everyone contributing a little to the survival of the group. There&rsquo;s been debate for years about how many hours a day working for survival (collecting food, processing it) takes them, at least those still surviving up to now.<br>In Europe pre-industrial societies, before the miracle of science and free market, did not actually conform to fantasies of back-breaking toil at the hands of evil lords and nobles<sup id=fnref:12><a href=#fn:12 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>12</a></sup>.<br>Sexual division of labor has never been a practical need, and in pre-human times we only had to climb the damn tree to eat, break open a beehive and munch some leaves. People&rsquo;s lives would naturally gravitate around what they like. African hunter-gatherers like Bushman or the !Kong on the other hand not only settled for the most part in unnatural (for apes) environments lacking most of what we need, but lack the brain to improve their daily life either by moving to an <strong>actually decent place</strong>, or learning to cultivate it like White people do.<figure class=aside><figcaption>Niggers gonna nig.</figcaption><a class=aside role=presentation target=_blank href=/Images/memes/meme_african_retardation.webp><img src=/Images/memes/meme_african_retardation.webp srcset="/Images/memes/meme_african_retardation.webp 378w, /Images/memes/meme_african_retardation_hu787d4a94494da4b2fa38e23489c4ab82_40714_200x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 200w" loading=lazy alt=d title="Niggers gonna nig." sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, (max-width: 600px) 50vw, 400px" width=378px height=481px style=--height-limit:481px></a></figure><p class=aside>In most traditional societies with vastly inefficient production methods and habits, Whites introducing any improvement that could cut work time or raise yield only ever faced the same almost automatic response: <q>why ?

As IQ tests show women as more centered on the mean, lacking much of the genius and high-achieving spectrum responsible for the advancement of society. Women maintain and relish in the status quo, men strive for what they perceive as progress: revolutionary groups, for ill or bad, were all male-dominated. Most women lack the ingenuity, curiosity and rationality to &ldquo;<em>take the next step</em>&rdquo; in any important reasoning<sup id=fnref:13><a href=#fn:13 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>13</a></sup>.<p>Curiosity or the lack thereof is a problem, but the worst one is the irrationality: <strong>As a general rule, how many women are capable of putting aside emotions when considering a sensitive issue, whatever that is ?</strong> Granted, nowadays few men can either, but I have yet to see even one woman managing when it comes to sexuality, children or what comes in and out of their own wombs. This is why women voting was a terrible idea.<p>But why have we got to that point and is it curable ?<br>We need to <strong>understand what it means on a deeper level</strong>.<br>Women lack divine inspiration, they lie on the base, material level, of sensation or sentiment. The call of destiny and total dedication to a spiritual ideal has been masculine all along history, with some exceptions of course.<p>There is little differentiation based on sex below puberty, and virgin girls keep longer an air of purity to them, as a fortiori do lesbians. On the other hand, mature girls most will simply react to novelty defensively because evolution made them wary of anything troubling the stability and safety of the nest, to raise the offspring.<p>All of this mirrors the divide between the reproductive instinctive program and metapsychic instinctive program and for obvious reasons females of all species (save for hyenas perhaps&mldr;) are easy to sway to a reproductive mindset, thus by nature leaning toward social <em>conservatism and conformism</em>, as keenly noted by many philosophers<sup id=fnref:14><a href=#fn:14 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>14</a></sup> is truer now than ever. But unlike earlier conservatives we believe in women&rsquo; bright future in a transfigured world, without cooking, now aligned with their deeper, lesbian and pederastic self.<p>In our society, as Freud put it, their lack of curiosity has to do with their lack of sexuality early on, as children, for which reaching the clitoris is notably harder without being introduced by someone else, namely a parent or older sibling. Even in a context of repression, a boy&rsquo;s sexual needs are always closer to his mind and his sex to his sight.<br>As a result he is much more likely to touch himself and not a single boy doesn&rsquo;t, be it in his dreams: on the other hand girls can easily spend their whole childhood, nay, life, without knowing a damn thing about her clitoris and so never orgasm a single time. Eternal sexual dissatisfaction makes them empty shells, superficial creatures living only on the level of sensation, yet without knowing the exhilarating feeling of being alive with adrenaline and electricity rushing through your veins which is synonymous with energy.<br>Girls who know how to satisfy themselves are better off, more lively, not featuring the meekness we usually ascribe to their sex.<p><strong>On the other hand</strong>, modern women show how engaging in such activities and the knowledge of orgasm did not help women much: frustration hasn&rsquo;t diminished. Instead it transmuted from a crude organic level to a much more important metapsychic dissatisfaction, the lack of <strong>energetic</strong> orgasms. Modern women&rsquo;s access to pleasure fuelled an unlimited sense of entitlement: anything that can fuel their vanity will do so. So we see it isn&rsquo;t an issue of pleasure, so much as of psychic structuring.<p id=female_breeding_weakness>All throughout history, people have noticed the female stunted, lower soul, lesser ability to think themselves to the Truth. Others assimilated this to a stronger animal nature compared to men, and that is entirely true, but modern society showed that cultural sexual repression of men on women isn&rsquo;t to blame as much as leftist thought, as today women can access pleasure as much as men (whether they actually do is not the absent patriarchy&rsquo;s fault !).<p>So men have more often than not been the leaders, chieftains, kings and emperors, with women catering for local communities, their own, maintaining the status quo whatever it is, fair or unfair, logic or not. Doesn&rsquo;t this somewhat lack in grandeur ?<br>I believe this lack of spark, of <strong>will to achieve</strong>, to be a direct expression of cooking and its dissimilar, very asymmetric: amplifying base animal instincts makes women meeker, just like the hen or cow submit to the cock or bull respectively. Within our genes and brain structures a whole set of character traits is ever present, stemming from ancient, outdated evolutionary pressures from millions to tens of millions of years ago, already present in the simplest animals to be honest - save for rare outliers like hyenas with aggressive girls boasting several times males&rsquo; testosterone rates.<p>This set of traits and tendencies form the core of lesser species whose entire lives around the need for reproduction (which is the one purpose of all lower lifeforms at least on the species&rsquo; level), is what we call the <strong>breeding instinctive program</strong>. What happens to women as this ancient evolutionary background is artificially stimulated by cooking, is a shift in life interests toward baser concerns seemingly all related to reproductive needs:<ul><li>Nesting: having a big, comfortable house (even when children are far, far ahead in the planning or unthinkable with current partners), cleaning the house, cooking (feeding the fledgeling !).<li>Gossiping<li>Keeping the men busy or downright manipulating them with sex in hope they continue providing resources and caring for kids, and ensuring said men don&rsquo;t see other females as it would dilute their attention.</ul><p>Men&rsquo; animal instincts are simpler, cruder, but also saved them from perdition: we males want to fuck, regardless of the situation. We at least <strong>do it</strong>, sometimes with little regards as to where. While our attention shifts from anality and polymorphisms to coitus, which is a terrible consequence, reaching some modicum of satisfaction is still easier, because both breeding and metasexual instincts push us toward stacking the body count, so to speak.<p>And both use the penis whereas the same shift toward coitus for women has had a very different consequence: the absolute center (and only source, anatomically) of pleasure for girls is their clitoris, which simply has no role whatsoever in a breeding situation. This leads girls in cooking to automatically disregard their clitoris even as they know it&rsquo;s there.<br>In general the more uninspired a woman is, the more her focus will shift from her obvious true needs (cumming) to manipulative behaviors, either through scheming (hence the endless gossiping) or submission to the male. Both attitudes conducive to keeping the male(s) to herself and her own material, social or emotional situation afloat. Even though in no way this appears to give her satisfaction or pleasure. Cooked females simply identify to their reproductive, forsaking entirely their eventual access to pleasure and so an eventual higher spiritual or cognitive development.<p>The patriarchy&rsquo;s prejudices against girls while indeed justified for the reasons explained above, when going too far - out of <strong>hatred</strong> - unfortunately <strong>added</strong> to female inferiority, cementing it: by relegating females sometimes by laws (Muslim and Jewish societies) into the exclusive breeding role they seem to focus on on their own accord, men have ensured women wouldn&rsquo;t improve on their tendencies. This is a classic case of our true nature being fallen and needing culture to bring itself to the fore.<p>That&rsquo;s why we need to enforce lesbianism and generate an upward movement subjecting women to the same hardships men have always known, in order to develop similar qualities. To <strong>man up</strong> and stop whining like little bitches.<figure><figcaption>Sexuality and learning are one</figcaption><a role=presentation target=_blank href=/Images/manga_comics/itou_lesbian.webp><img src=/Images/manga_comics/itou_lesbian_hu62a3fcbabcbaa5f8f8b3da2ed24079fa_1495838_800x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp srcset="/Images/manga_comics/itou_lesbian_hu62a3fcbabcbaa5f8f8b3da2ed24079fa_1495838_800x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 800w, /Images/manga_comics/itou_lesbian_hu62a3fcbabcbaa5f8f8b3da2ed24079fa_1495838_604x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 604w, /Images/manga_comics/itou_lesbian_hu62a3fcbabcbaa5f8f8b3da2ed24079fa_1495838_400x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 400w, /Images/manga_comics/itou_lesbian_hu62a3fcbabcbaa5f8f8b3da2ed24079fa_1495838_200x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 200w" loading=lazy alt=lesbian_teacher title="Sexuality and learning are one" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, (max-width: 600px) 50vw, 400px" width=800px height=1130px style=--height-limit:1130px></a></figure><p>On the opposite, the insane privileges and unfairly easy treatment bestowed on women compared to men in this disgusting feminist society in sheer virtue of their genitalia (best instance being the military and dumbing down of standards to accommodate weak women) <strong>infantilized</strong> the former.

Most cultures have disapproved of it, nearly all in fact, to no one&rsquo;s surprise: only someone desperate would resort to force to get sexual attention. Everyone would be appalled by the pain, blood and injuries, that much is obvious, and the criminal would be swiftly punished, if found, most often by the family of the victim, assuming she has one. In the past, justice concerned more the honor of the clan, of the wronged husband and the risk of unknowingly birthing and nurturing the rapist&rsquo; child, at times where knowledge of biology paled compared to ours.<p>However our current feminist culture is of the rare on record, seeing in forced copulations something as diabolical as do we do today, the killing of the soul, leaving a taint even
<a href=https://www.psycom.net/trauma/epigenetics-trauma rel="external nofollow" target=_blank>for generations to come</a> ! Many cultures, matriarchal and patriarchal, considered the act pathetic or disgraceful but didn&rsquo;t care much either way, or deemed the female victim partly to blame. Matrioski relate about Trobriandese, how a woman was raped and after the fact commented <q>it wasn&rsquo;t so bad</q>.<br>Simply put, when people aren&rsquo;t too repressed and sex is available, no one but morons would rape. But no one <strong>at all</strong> would display sadism, and no woman would even resist to the point of fighting for her life, because her life or well-being would not never be in danger. So already compulsive impulses had no occasion to escalate. And finally, in decent cultures, virginity has always been an embarrassing stain to get rid of, a proof no one wanted to love you, not even a relative.<p>Rape exists in nature as a valid breeding strategy, but in humans only happens under cooked conditions when low self-control meets pent-up sexual and/or energetic frustration (and resentment, toward one woman or all of them) <strong>that become compulsive</strong>. Forceful demonstrations, up to and including rapes, can be understood as desperate calls to help, turning sour. In a situation where acting out is a psychological necessity, the guilt and fear of punishment the more things risk getting out of hand, with victims dying as a consequence. Because sex is not just about pleasure&mldr; that much can be obtained with a hand or two.<br>Behind, we find the need for <strong>energy</strong>, the food of the soul. <strong>The most important food in existence</strong>. That explains why its lack can make people mad, crazy with resentment against society and those they deem should provide him with said sustenance&mldr; women or children. As such, sexual distress is society&rsquo;s disease most of the time, and we should try to look with compassion to sexual offenders who carry its symptoms, <em>when no serious hurt has been done seriously</em><sup id=fnref:15><a href=#fn:15 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>15</a></sup>.

When your survival is at play, feelings cease to matter. And not just the war, but working in factories - while absolutely necessary for the war efforts - also was widely considered as unfitting for women, too masculinizing. Despite reassuring declarations that no one would sane consider keeping women at home as mere breeding machines[^Goebbels], they were effectively discouraged if not outright banned from participating in a gradually increased number of activities:
```quote{cite=&#34;[The Nazis, women and employment](https://www.tutor2u.net/history/reference/the-nazis-women-and-employment)&#34;}
Whilst initially the Nazis used propaganda to encourage them to leave the workforce and focus on the home, the Nazis did introduce laws and policies which would remove and restrict women in the labor force.

For example from a young age, the Nazis taught girls that their place was in the home and were taught how to achieve this. They focused on lessons in housework such as cooking, needlework and ironing. They also studied racial science so that they would be able to pick suitable Ayran husbands in the future. In 1937 the Nazis banned girls from attending grammar schools which were seen as a way of encouraging girls into university.

Women faced restrictions from 1933 when the Nazis banned women from holding jobs in professional employment such as doctors and teachers. This was then extended in 1936 to include jobs within the justice system, which included the right to serve on a jury.

But I wish to stress: we know well enough that this book is riddled to the brim with unverifiable, ridiculous and hateful unfounded assumptions, and the authors are worth less than scum, basically seeing sodomites as the worst sinners imaginable, responsible for everything bad happening on Earth <em>ever</em>.<p><em>Yet</em>, and this is where you must understand <dfn>our attitude regarding historical documents</dfn>
. If we assume a double-discours and strong hypocrisy, and a more important sexual deviancy not just in Nazi Germany but Nazi institutions themselves than what Himmler said, who is more likely to provide any source of information on this topic ? Neo-nazi reactionaries, most of them of reduced IQ, who wish nothing less than being related in any way to the current LGBT fad, or our very enemies ?<p>This is a strange yet common situation in which both sides of the political spectrum, at least their dominant representatives, Christian or not, share the so-called Christian values, marriage, homophobia, sexual repression etc. The Right has mostly been phagocytosed by Christian-minded if not Christian elements. So regardless of historical truth homosexuality (or whatever else deviant practice) will continue being a hot potato Conservatives and National-Socialists pass to another, as long as the latter still endorses Abrahamic sexual repression, that led to horrible practices such as infibulation and excision (yes, in the West) to guard children from temptation.<p>Hence because of their pollution by Christian ideology historical Nazi leaders have all the interest in the world to deny homosexuality, and can never be trusted. On the other hand our enemies can be trusted for digging out the slightest piece of inconvenient truth about ourselves, our past, glorious or not, though at the cost of twisting horribly. So if you want to uncover what we find inconvenient there is no better source of information than people ideologically opposed to us. Then, we have to either isolate the purely factual parts by accessing the primary source. Fairly easy most of the time. And when not possible, we must work to separate the interpretation from a kernel of likely factual truth.<p>But because this involves an interpretative work of our own, one can only purify the truth by by holding the correct theory or at least intuition, of <em>how things should be</em>. Without an inkling of where to look, one can search forever. And we know that our theory and intuitions are correct because it has been proved experimentally.<br>Early boy scouts organizations were rife with pederastic, homosexual relationships, as could attest Guy-Claude Burger. This wasn&rsquo;t much of a secret in France or the US, and this accusation (far from groundless) persisted up until now. However it has never been as explicitly and proudly assumed, even theorized, as in the romantic Wandervoegel group born at the end of XIXth century.<p>Hans Bluher became very influential in it after 1912, with the explicit wish to the Greek love ethos, uniting erotic attraction and transmission of values and knowledge. He also advocated for a militaristic, antisemitic and misogynistic society based on virile values<sup id=fnref:20><a href=#fn:20 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>20</a></sup>, which pederasty would sustain and develop. They created many of the symbolism, ethos and even costumes of Hitlerjugend<sup id=fnref:21><a href=#fn:21 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>21</a></sup>, which absorbed them after 1933, even creating many of their rituals and symbolism. At its peak the movement as a whole reached 80 000 members, many of those seamlessly joined National-Socialist groups, the SA among others. Quite a few authors back then had similar ideas, such Adolf Brand or Friedlander, though the opinion on the role of heterosexual men and women as a whole would vary, from tolerance to denigration.<p>Since 1928 already, National-socialists often railed against homosexuality depicted as a Jewish conspiracy, while tolerating a few publically homosexual figures such as Röhms, while the Left, both before and after the war, accused them of the same very same thing, being a bunch of homosexuals, a recurring theme in 1930s left-wing propaganda. However, due to the phrasing of the law and Germans sticking to the words of the law, conviction required proving penetration through direct witnesses, and so were rare, and
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_homosexuals_in_Nazi_Germany rel="external nofollow" target=_blank>even more rarely resulted in more than one year in jail sentence</a>.<blockquote>In 1934, the Gestapo reported forty cases of pederasty in just one troop of the Htiler Youth. Bleuel writes of the case of one supervisor, a 20-year-old man who was dismissed from the Hitler YOuth in 1938. Yet he was transferred to the National Socialist flying Corps (Civil air Patrol) <q>and was assigned to supervise work by members of the Hitler Youth Gliding Association and eventually detained to help with physical check-ups, a grievous temptation. The man was once again caught sodomizing young men, but was not dismissed from the NSFK</blockquote><p>Conditions were essentially the same in 1941. Bleuel reports of another homosexual flying instructor involved in <q>at least ten cases of homosexuality with student pilots of the Hitler Youth</q> and <q>a student teacher and student&mldr; had committed twenty-eighty acts of indecency with twenty boys at Hitler Youth and Young Folk camps</q>. <q>These cases were only the tip of the iceberg, for few misdemeanors within the Party became public in later years and even fewer came to trial</q>.<br>In the light of this, we believe that persecution of homosexuals in Nazi Germany was not genuine. 40 years ago, more than half of all priests were full-on pedophiles acting whenever the occasion presented itself, so much that <q>pedophile priest</q> became a truism in the minds of people. Most people did not care, despite in truth knowing well enough. This was no different in Germany in 1928-1945, providing an excellent opportunity for Nazis to silence the Church, rabid political opponents.

Not with men though.<p>Overall, the ambiguous German attitude toward sexuality, is representative of the incapacity of Hitler, or the regime itself, to take a definite public stance on a number of social topics, resulting in widely inconstant policies impossible to make head or tail of without the precise political context of the <em>year</em>. Sometimes repressive, sometimes eerily in line with usual anarchist or communist stances against bourgeois squeamishness regarding the naked body, sex and pleasure.

The sensibility of women is directed to this. A woman never forgets that someone thought her ugly; a woman never considers herself ugly; the successes of others at the most only make her think of herself as perhaps less attractive. But no woman ever believes herself to be anything but beautiful and desirable when she looks at herself in the glass; she never accepts her own ugliness as a painful reality as a man would, and never ceases to try to persuade others of the contrary.<br>What is the source of this form of vanity, peculiar to the female?

As she sets no store by herself or on herself, she endeavors to attain a value in the eyes of others by exciting their desire and admiration. The only thing which has any absolute and ultimate value in the world is the soul. <q>Ye are better than many sparrows</q> were Christ’s words to mankind. A woman does not value herself by the constancy and freedom of her personality; but this is the only possible method for every creature possessing an ego. But if a real woman, and this is certainly the case, can only value herself at the rate of the man who has fixed his choice on her; if it is only through her husband or lover that she can attain to a value not only in social and material things, but also in her innermost nature, it follows that she possesses no personal value, she is devoid of man’s sense of the value of his own personality for itself.<br><strong>And so women always get their sense of value from something outside themselves</strong>, from their money or estates, the number and <em>richness of their garments</em>, the position of their box at the opera, <em>their children</em>, and, above all, their husbands or lovers. When a woman is quarreling with another woman, her final weapon, and the weapon she finds most effective and discomfiting, is to proclaim her superior social position, her wealth or title, and, above all, her youthfulness and the devotion of her husband or lover; <em>whereas a man in similar case would lay himself open to contempt if he relied on anything except his own personal individuality</em>.</blockquote><cite>Otto Weiniger—Sex and Character</cite>

The exact sentence is<blockquote><p>Proditores et transfugas arboribus hang, ignauos et imbelles et corpore infames caeno ac palude, iniecta insuper crate, mergunt</blockquote><p>Translating <em>literally</em> to:<blockquote><p>Traitors and deserters are hanged from trees, as for cowards and <strong>those who use their bodies infamously</strong>, they are plunged into the mud of a swamp, taking care to throw a wicker grid over them.</blockquote><p>The Reichsführer therefore peremptorily interpreted <q>corpore infames</q>, that is, <q>those who use their bodies infamously</q>, by <q>homosexual</q>. However, this interpretation is inadmissible for two reasons.<br>– First of all, homosexuality was not considered dishonorable in these pre-Christian eras; what was, was homosexual rape, which victorious warriors often inflicted on defeated soldiers, and it was the <q>rape</q> aspect that was, because rape is always dishonorable whether it is homosexual or heterosexual. However, in the sentence there is no mention of sexual coercion. It is clearly specified <q>those who do</q> and not <q>those who suffer</q>.<br>– Which brings us to the second objection: there is, in fact, no question of sex at all, but only of cowardice by the refusal to go into battle. Sexuality, homo- or hetero-, has nothing to do with its explanation. It must also be considered that Tacitus uses the Latin syntax to describe the mores of these Barbarians, and that semantically in Roman infamia was a lifelong stigma inflicted by the censors, which may consist of physical mutilation. These organized drownings were therefore a punishment inflicted on men who mutilated themselves to make themselves unfit for combat - an act that will be found during the Napoleonic era, for example, where young people cut off their index and middle fingers. right hand <q>by accident</q> so as not to be able to shoot a rifle, or a few toes so as not to be able to take long walks, and therefore avoid being recruited. The text of Tacitus speaks of cowards and cowards, and that is why they are punished, not for their sexuality. <q>Using one&rsquo;s body infamously</q> therefore means, in this context, <q>deliberately inflicting injury on oneself to render oneself unfit for war</q>.</blockquote>&#160;<a href=#fnref:23 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a><li id=fn:24><blockquote><p>In Mein Kampf Hitler had attacked the ‘saint’s cloak of prudishness’worn by the bourgeoisie, and his sympathy for other aspects of lifestyle reform such as vegetarianism and abstinence was well-known, yet he had also attacked the Weimar Republic as a ‘hothouse of sexual ideas and stimuli’. The conflicts and uncertainty within the Nazi régime over the issue of naturism were therefore typical of the many areas of policy where the Führer was unwilling or unable to commit himself to a public position. In the absence of a definitive order from above, lower-ranking figures in the National Socialist hierarchy were able to play out their own tastes and prejudices, and these varied widely: ‘some did indeed want a return to more conservative values and behaviors, but many others worked to detach emancipatory impulses from their association with “Marxism” and “Jewishness” and to redefine sexual liberation as a “Germanic”, “Aryan” prerogative.’<p>But who knows was the next generation, raised to value strength and independence of thought, would have decided ? What kind of culture would they create ? We will never know but we believe something great, increasingly closer to their Nordic heritage, discarding old prejudices.. Such a people would have been open to social change on a rational basis, much more that has been the case in the democratic new world order.</blockquote><cite>Matthew Jefferies, University of Manchester—‘For a Genuine and Noble Nakedness’?

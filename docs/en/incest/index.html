This carefree morale that founded Western culture was as distant from the common globohomo LGBTIQ+ pleasure-obsessed and self-centered modern cult of utter degeneracy praised in today&rsquo;s liberal circles, as to conservative &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; thinking.<p>Magic was a prominent part of culture: Seiðr, Spà, Galdr, Runesseiðr, sorcery, however we want to call it&mldr; Today we call it the metapsychics, or ESP for extrasensory perception. But it always existed in known history and beyond, down to our ape ancestry as opposed to most other lower lifeforms, knowing only breeding. Even in what we consider as modern neo-Liberal and <em>progressive</em> European countries such as Germany, incestuous couples and individuals are a heavily persecuted group, with their basic human rights removed upon the revelation of this deviancy in the eyes of the supposedly progressive state.<p>Reading from Norse Sagas, it appears clearly that in the original pan-European Nordic society that traditional social structures (marriages, trade) were merely formal customs, somewhat necessary to the functioning of society but of secondary importance in comparison to honor, bravery and integrity were paramount values. Freya and Freyr were twin god and goddess of sex and fertility, and lovers while married to others, while Odin&rsquo;s wife Frigg routinely slept with Odin&rsquo;s three brothers in his absence, with his approval and this was no secret. A give-and-take sort of agreement given Odin&rsquo;s own famous disregard of faithfulness, while Loki would shape-shift into a female horse, got humped by a stallion and <em>gave birth as a horse</em>.<p><strong>Promiscuity was the norm among gods</strong>. Norse gods were especially fond of incest and very self-aware. The gods embraced freely their own deviancy, and it didn&rsquo;t hinder Norsemen and women to worship them. When all gods are debauchees, <em>debauchery</em> becomes moral.<p>We can deduce that these myths reflected the on-going fight, on a near conscious level, between the desire to fuck the brains out of your wide-eyed long-haired aryan sister mindless, and economic and social imperatives (clan politics, marriages) straying more and more from the immediate satisfaction of human needs, growing more and more parasitic, sucking people&rsquo;s life and demanding more and more submission of the individual.

</span>Whites(1948) proposes that the rule of incest, in the strongest (taboo) terms, requires that individuals and groups seek economic and military cooperation through the institutions of family and marriage when other institutions such as government and economy (the state) are absent. <em>Going outside one&rsquo;s family and immediate group to seek a partner is rewarded with access to sex and other adult status and privileges.</em> These rewards provide a more personal incentive to extend social ties, going beyond the economic and military needs of the kinship group, community and/or society. The strength of this rule suggests the urgent cultural need for such alliances. Exceptions to these rules are relatively rare, and punishments usually harsh.</blockquote><cite>Leavitt, Gregory C.—</cite></dl><p>In the same way these alliances are sometimes fundamental in a strategy of avoidance of the conflicts at the primitive ones: To Goodenough (1953) asked a tribe of the highlands of New Guinea &ldquo;Can you marry with such a group?&rdquo;" their positive answer was often &ldquo;Yes, we fight&rdquo;.

At the core we remain animals. <strong>Modern human relations</strong>, have always been built on a fundamental inner want, both creating the handicap and providing the clutch, in the form of institutions, such as marriage and religion (at least the neurotic part of it). Sexual repression, coextensive with the progress of culture sublimated more and more sexual energy into forced outbreeding - prohibiting the fulfillment of Oedipus (the subconscious romantic affinity for our parents) renders man forever incapable of total and ineffable abandon in love, the dissolving into the <em>Id</em> (in French the &ldquo;Ça&rdquo;, English &ldquo;It&rdquo;, the well of instincts and desires), <strong>incapable of regaining the undivided unity of the child suckling its mother</strong>.<p>At the same time, civilization would guarantee order and calm, an order that domesticated external nature (wild animals, crops, etc.) as much as it did our internal nature, allowing one to no longer be at the mercy of other tyrannical &ldquo;I&rsquo;s&rdquo;, who are as little inclined to take your interests into account as you are to take theirs.<p>On the other hand&mldr; Sociobiologists, a school nowadays very popular, simply postulates an instinctive horror of incest, a kind of negative imprinting from those raised with us, that evolution must have selected to avoid consanguinity. Yet upon further analysis this stance appears as groundless as farcical, both from a social and <strong>biological standpoint</strong> as is demonstrated in the next section.<h3 id=flawed-postulates class=headings><a href=#flawed-postulates>Flawed postulates</a></h3><p>The limit of acceptable endogamy changes a lot from place to place and time to time, and even in cultures with strong consciousness about the &ldquo;danger&rdquo; of incest, we may find the actual repression not matching its description, and in some context absent. Starting with structuralists: They confused love (and sexuality) with marriages, while until the XVIIIth century in the West the general rule has always been their separation.<p>The idea that the social order can only be maintained by forcing young men into obedience in exchange for sexual satisfaction in the form of marriage, is silly. After all, of either sex men have always been (by far) the least bound by marital ties, as obvious with the omnipresence of prostitution at all times, or other extramarital loves including homosexual ones. In fact such outlets were often encouraged especially in the upper classes, as the guarantors of social order. When push comes to shove, one&rsquo;d rather fuck a random hoe than the mayor&rsquo;s daughter !<p>Roman patricians, the poster child of patriarchy, conceived marriage as a necessary evil to ensure the continuity of the state. Hardly as a moral matter. In antiquity the fidelity of Roman men has never been required before Christianity, while for women the concern was expressly to avoid polluting the family bloodline, with genitors whose value no one could ascertain.<p>On the other hand, adoption was common especially among nobles, even for girls despite their absence of matrimonial use. This must be replaced in its original context where pure Patricians had to suffer the racial danger (and potential sexual predation) of inferior swarthier plebeians. This suffices to show that marriage was originally and for the longest time, a very natural eugenic urge to ascertain an offspring&rsquo;s racial purity or worth (notions originally synonymous) and not a neurotic need to enforce some egotic need for possessivity as displayed by the likes of Islamists. Many literary examples lead to fairly different and carefree portraits of Roman morals<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup>. Saturnalia also regularly saw real orgies take place, without participants being held responsible.<p>And beyond the dramatic importance <em>incestus</em> has in Roman legal and religious (synonymous words for them&mldr;) writings, we should stop and consider <strong>what</strong> consequence and punishment it really brought.<br>&ldquo;Incestus&rdquo; meant a wild variety of things, but mostly two. Sex with a Vestale, punished by death, and intercourse within the forbidden degrees of consanguinity, including first degree incest.<br>The latter was merely punished by <strong>relegatio</strong> which meant &ldquo;the mildest form of exile, involving banishment from Rome, but not loss of citizenship, or confiscation of property&rdquo;. But evidence shows that in Rome for incestuous couples willing to live outside Rome itself but anywhere else in any other city, there seemingly was no real consequences.<blockquote class=aside><p>Epictetus praised a stoic senator who heard he had been condemned in his absence:- To exile, says he, or to death?<ul><li>To exile<li>What about my property?<li>It has not been confiscated<li><em>Well then, let us go to Arica
<span class=inner-comments tooltip="Personal comment">[ - first stop outside Rome - ]
</span>and take our lunch there</em>.</ul></blockquote><p>The real engine of social change has always been the perception of the sacred and the transcendent, projected on all sorts of things. Sex when it comes to deep cultural changes, takes its value much less from the procreative side of things, than to its innate association with the sacred. The idea that men may be possessed of transcultural innate desires driving piloting history is just not conceivable for sociology, explicitly denying any transcendance, in the purest marxist/Jewish tradition.<p>As a matter of fact the overwhelming majority of cultures studied so far that do condemn incest both ancient and extant only concern themselves with <strong>mariages</strong> (relative to whatever kinship system is in usage), <strong>not sexual relationships themselves</strong>. I could only find one researcher realizing the incongruity of what amounts to a grave and systematic case of cognitive dissonance or conceptual myopia, leading to a complete disregard of love outside matrimony as a culturally-significant reality.<blockquote class=aside>Some scholars see the requirement to marry outside the close kinship group as derived from prohibitions on sexual relations, while others assume that the rules governing this choice of spouse (exogamy) account for the prohibitions on sexual intercourse.<br>It goes without saying that if society has established a permanent prohibition against a sexual relationship between two individuals, no marriage between them will be possible. <em>But a marriage prohibition does not necessarily imply a prohibition against a <strong>sexual relationship</strong></em>. Marriage, to mention the most important difference, is usually a <em>public affair</em> which establishes <em>relationships between groups</em>.</blockquote><cite>Paul John Frandsen—Incestuous and Close-Kin Marriage in Ancient Egypt and Persia An Examination of the Evidence</cite><p>History and anthropology suffer greatly from the over-reliance on texts, considered as an objective source of information on people&rsquo;s thinking, instead of what they really are, normative discourses made by and for a certain class, a story we wish to tell about ourselves or others.<p>In Greece, (in Athenes at least) only incest through the maternal line was considered, so half-siblings from the father side could marry several famous philosophers could openly discuss that topic<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup>, which after all did not have the omnipotence we would assume from the same people that gave us the Oedipus complex.<br>Samewise, Plato&rsquo;s Republic<sup id=fnref:3><a href=#fn:3 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>3</a></sup> describes a rational society in which knowing telling apart one&rsquo;s siblings was discouraged, and actual incest <em>sanctioned by the gods</em>. Stoicism and Cynics also criticized the arbitrariness of the taboo.<p>Thus it stands to reason that such concepts were not, in fact, so horrifying to contemplate for Greeks. And they only really disliked mother-son relationships, though well-known philosophers (Stoics in particular) did run counter to this taboo, of course without any repercussions. Overall Greeks cared <strong>far</strong> more about the respect of personal property and political rights than we do, and people were free to do as they pleased, as long as it did not not impede others, their properties or defile the few religious places.<p>Moreover, several cultures far from fearing it, <strong>openly
<a href=/#Persia>worshiped</a> incest</strong>.

Ergo, for those with the misfortune of a terrible birth, physically disabled or worse, intellectually, death is not a problem because their souls will find a better body.<p>Not to sterilize (at least) the disabled and handicapped is the end of natural selection. Defective genes pollute the good ones and good health, strength, intelligence, any desirable quality, become in a few decades of intensive indiscriminate breeding, a thing of the past.<p>The humane and logical solution is sterilization and adoption, a policy still followed by many civilized nations until the 1960s. It is an absolute necessity, as mere inbreeding without selection only causes defective alleles to settle and increase in frequency in human groups like the Amish, and physically degenerates individuals multiply.

It is <strong>incomplete</strong> inbreeding which degenerates us, in a society in which thanks to technology and agriculture survival does not depend on individual fitness any longer, by not lowering survivability enough to screen out bad alleles.<dl class=important><dt>This phenomenon is called <dfn>genetic purge</dfn>

Due to epistasy and trans interactions, all complex traits are highly multigenic and might not be possible to isolate from other traits in a mendelian fashion. The best way to preserve those traits depending precise combinations, is group or family selection: one gets a much better idea of a person&rsquo; hereditary potential by looking at its family and <em>breeding the family as a whole</em>. Otherwise, breeding high IQ people whose family is only sub-average would produce an <strong>outlier</strong> unable to pass on its qualities. That is why ideas like race-blind or &ldquo;IQ nationalism&rdquo; are nonsense: similar qualities in different races (for instance, skull size) depend on different and sometimes incompatible coadapted genes, which run much deeper than the eye can see.<p>Races separated by tens to hundreds of thousands of years, even of comparable brain size, can not blend satisfyingly: our mind, qualities and tendencies originate from separate factors, separate evolutive pathways, and in absence of extrasensory directives, should remain separate. Moreover, seemingly successful outliers among mixed individuals, always revert toward the statistical means of their race(s)
. Even in plants hybrid vigor can not lead to the creation of stable lines: the &ldquo;happy&rdquo; combination (usually from an economic perspective only) obtained that way do not always breed true, because subsequent recombinations quickly dismantle them, despite the most elaborate breeding scheme. Evolution either marks such an approach with sterility, or <em>condemns it to countless generations of misadaptation and mediocrity</em>.<p>In the animal world, it is the universal occurrence of incest that we observe, not its taboo.

Information leading authorities to conclude that &ldquo;the ratio of deleterious and lethal recessive genes to selectively advantageous genes is very high indeed&rdquo; and &ldquo;the biological advantages of the familial incest taboo cannot be ignored&rdquo;. While in reality what was ignored was the wild disparity in genetic quality between both ethnicities and groups within them.<p>Studies made with South India Pakistan and Japan, all countries of doubtful if not disgusting racial origins - plus only allowing <em>incomplete</em> incest and refraining from any form of eugenics - rated the excess mortality at 16 to 20% and the total morbidity fo first degree incests to <strong>22 to 36%</strong>.<p>As shown later by non-extrapolative but concrete statistics with real incestuous partners <em>of a decent stock</em> debunk those delusional figures . If the specter of national-socialism and World War II had not plagued everyone&rsquo;s minds, the inanity of averaging such figures over whole population - then generalizing to all humanity - would have struck as nonsensical from the get-go.<p>Incomplete selection (such as laws favoring cousin marriages but not closer, or marrying according to wealth and not hereditary qualities) amounts to constantly stirring up the blood, increasing heterozygosity, blurring the line between good blood and bad blood. To get rid of genetic flaws, they must be allowed to express themselves, or no selection can occur, hence no improvement, and <em>the eventual fixation of bad but non-lethal traits</em>.<p>Hence Pakistan, other Arab countries and the Habsburg family, all being the results of partial consanguinity with actively impeded natural selection. On the contrary, inbreeding not only occurs frequently in natural populations but is in fact characteristically adaptive in many social, territorial, long-lived, low-birth-rate populations. Shields gives several examples of close inbreeding in great ape species.<h3 id=philopatry class=headings><a href=#philopatry>Philopatry</a></h3><p>Philopatry (living and reproducing in the same place) and endogamy (reproducing with those close to you genetically), leads to inbreeding whether it be animals or plants, because you necessarily have spend more time, so have more opportunity to breed with relatives by living in the same place.<p>It appears that <em>low dispersion is the norm in nature</em>, in plants or animals, <em>contradicting the notion that one must spread and conquer new territories</em>. It also implies that new generations inherit an environment identical or very similar to that of the parents. Hence a constant selective pressure, going in the same direction. These conditions <em>theoretically disfavor sexual reproduction</em>, as it inevitably halves the material inherited, from the perspective of each parent. Instead, an unchanging environment would promote cloning or <strong>inbreeding</strong>, as an individual will pass more of its own alleles to its offspring by bonding with close relatives, sharing most of its blood.<p>So in a few generations a population can drastically reduce its overall mutational load. <strong>Addition of new blood might allow for an healthier first hybrid generation, but it only masks the defects that have not been eliminated yet, or might have fixed due to genetic drift</strong> (random high variation in allele frequency, which comes with too short of a breeding population).<br>But hybrid vigor quickly disappears as a corresponding amount of bad alleles also polluted the gene pool, perhaps in greater quantity than present in the consanguineous population but which were silent until now, hidden by heterozygosity (the presence in a single instance), and <strong>all the selection work must be redone.</strong><sup id=fnref:6><a href=#fn:6 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>6</a></sup><blockquote class="aside important"><p>More so, Charli said, than what we’ve always done, when you look at it that way.

Then competition might determine which group represents the future of the species. While this dispersal is often cited as a strong argument for incest avoidance primates, this is incorrect and has more to do with an instinctive mechanism to regulate population-size in accordance to the ecological bearing capacity (how much food there is).

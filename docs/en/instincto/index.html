Experiences on thousands of people showed consequences to be so numerous and far-reaching, that the recent advent of cooking in prehistory can be likened to the Fall in Genesis, and the mythology of many cultures around the world, such the Greek myth of the 5 races and

In fact our very understanding of disease is wrong, as represented by the fallacious Germ theory whose own creator understood that the terrain of the body is what plays a crucial role in the progress of disease.<br>However, with a certain amount of food discipline and a fairly broad range of healthy foods, <strong>a very strict discipline and obedience to the sense of smell</strong> (letting the body determine its needs), we can use our body as it was meant, once again.<p>It is possible to awaken our eating instinct, which all animals have, and bring about <strong>the near complete elimination of disease</strong>, especially as a life-threatening phenomena. Strength, agility, recovery time, mental acuity, all stats improve samewise on their own, fairly quickly, in proportion to the quality of your diet (and secondarily of your genetics).

Aseptic autolysis is the rupture or degradation of cell membranes and cell walls, through programmed cell death, without the action of bacteria. Degradation by bacteria means rotting. The processes are not totally distinct as they occur simultaneously: in mammals, certain bacteria are transferred from the mother to the child, the same bacteria which after death and the cessation of regulation by the immune system, are responsible for the onset of putrefaction.<p>The online encyclopedia <em>Gastronomiac</em> defines ripening as follows:<blockquote><p>Operation that consists in leaving a game animal in a cool place for a variable period of time (up to 8 days, and even more for some amateurs) in order to tenderize its flesh and obtain a particular flavor under the effect of mortification. This aroma is produced by germs in the intestine, which invade the tissues and break down the proteins, producing substances which, in the long run, become toxic. Mushrooms are also involved in the practice of dry curing, where they form a kind of hard green crust on the outside of the piece of meat: they actually help the enzymes in meat tenderizing and add flavor. This crust is then removed.</blockquote><p>We no longer push aging to the point of <q>altering the scent</q> as Montagne advocated in the 16th century, until the 19th century when Brillat-Savarin, the inventor of the eponymous cheese, is said to have said that he <q>bothered all his colleagues with the smell of the game he brought in his pockets to have it aged</q>.</p><a role=presentation target=_blank href=/Images/images_article_instincto/bidonville-sacs-plastique-emballages-alimentaires-autres.webp><img src=/Images/images_article_instincto/_huae6193081a4028fb48fee30c2fc997bc_907122_b3cb175a738432520131f9b2d94e7d60.webp srcset="/Images/images_article_instincto/_huae6193081a4028fb48fee30c2fc997bc_907122_b3cb175a738432520131f9b2d94e7d60.webp 800w, /Images/images_article_instincto/_huae6193081a4028fb48fee30c2fc997bc_907122_adf8a5cfbe5bde6507019a10b896392d.webp 604w, /Images/images_article_instincto/_huae6193081a4028fb48fee30c2fc997bc_907122_49d274a7076d67507a95b7c6d3c68e77.webp 400w, /Images/images_article_instincto/_huae6193081a4028fb48fee30c2fc997bc_907122_deab22fdd1ba6c7779d4837c684d8668.webp 200w" loading=lazy alt=bidonville2 sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, (max-width: 600px) 50vw, 400px" width=800px height=533px style=--height-limit:533px>

There could not be a better copout strategy than finding drunk animals.<br>Even if half those cases are fake and the remaining highly misleading, we will show it. It wouldn&rsquo;t even warrant my time writing this, if a number of scientists too had not been called to accredit those myths.<p>The problem is similar to that of drugs or other natural psychotropic/psychogenic substances. It can be summed up in 3 points:<ol><li>Does it exist in <em>wild</em> nature in a concentration great enough to produce any physiological effect ?<li>If so, are animals instinctively guarded against too high a concentration ?<li>Can they acquire a preference for it, if so in what conditions ?</ol><p>Very weak concentrations of alcohol, compared to even beers, arise as a natural product of sugar fermentation in fruits, nectar or sap. But science is definitive on this topic: the quantity is not enough to be a danger. Obviously that will depend on several factors, not just dietary availability (with primates, the amount of fruits rotting on the ground), but the composition of said fermented/alcoholic food in the animal&rsquo;s diet, and its metabolic rate. By virtue of natural selection, animals routinely eating a big proportion of sugar (especially if susceptible to ferment) will have a bigger liver relative to their size, and higher levels of Alcohol Dehydrogenases (ADH), the enzymes responsible for breaking down ethanol.<p>And the physiological tolerance to alcohol concentration in our blood also differs, so that only experimental results can decide what does or not cause ebriety. And observation in relatively health rainforests does show that the species consumming high amounts of fermented nectar or yeast do exist but show no sign of intoxication. Similarly inducing alcohol dependence on ape has proven very difficult: they do <strong>not</strong> like it, neither the taste nor the effect it has on them, and only drink it when forced by circumstances.<p>One can theorize without too much difficulty, that exposition of the cocktail of thousands of new chemical compounds each cooking recipes magnifies reward circuits a hundred times, creating evolutionary counter-intuitive though a powerful dependency neurologically identical to that of drugs<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup>. Unsurprisingly this finding raised a whole lot of controversies, since it amounts to calling nearly everyone liking sweets a druggie<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup>. Except that people very high on industrial sugar absolutely match the description. This kind of criticism smells a lot like a defense mechanism to me ! How on Earth does the relative peace of getting one&rsquo;s dose at regular intervals proving that it&rsquo;s not a drug ? People are addicted to tobacco and it doesn&rsquo;t seem to alter their personality <em>but only as long as they can smoke</em><sup id=fnref:3><a href=#fn:3 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>3</a></sup>.<p>Cooking as a whole appears much harder to withdraw from than mere just white sugar (or saccharine). It may be essentially socio-psychological <em>- arguably ? -</em> but to master the will to forgo all recipes and follow one&rsquo;s instinct is more difficult than to stop drinking or smoking, one paar with cocaine addiction. As for the preference for <em>natural</em> sources of alcohol <em>in the wild</em>, no study was ever conducted.<p>Studies of inborn preference of alcohol in the wild for higher vertebrates are <em>absent</em>. We do have a study about chimpanzees in the wild but with proper alcohol, and not in a form we could possibly ever evolve to regulate. Fermented fruits lie on the ground every now and then. <em>Fermented sap on the other hand lies outside the range of what could occur in nature</em>

Chimpanzees drink sap from the tree, never brewing for a minute, let alone a week. A minute of reasoning should suffice to realize that evolution was in no way required to guard us against fermented sap impossible to find in nature.<p><em>As all forms of processing brewing is likely to bypass natural regulations</em>. So to assume from the behavior of <q>wild</q> chimps eating who-knows-what that the common ancestors of all primates developed an <strong>inborn tendency for alcoholism</strong> goes beyond stupidity, into the realm of willful deceit of public opinion.<p>Assuming an uncontrolled natural disposition for alcohol, for megafauna (animals our size or bigger) to get drunk one would require enormous amount of fermented fruits at the same place and time incompatible with any notion of instinctive regulation, so that an automatic vomitive reflex would kick in before the alcohol level could rise in any capacity. It is a fact that natural food almost never reaches beer-levels of ethanol, let alone degrees higher than 3%.<br>So in any case to argue an hypothetical taste for a 1 to 1.5% degree in food still wouldn&rsquo;t account for humans&rsquo; addiction or taste to the likes of cider (3%) beer (4.2%) whine (5%) sake (15%) or whisky (40%). The tolerance to a certain substance selected by evolution has to reflect the conditions found in our environment, which never included anything higher than 2% at the very worst in any appreciable quantity. Therefore no evolutionary argument can explain a taste for alcohol beverage.<p>Only the paradoxical physiological state induced by cooking, plus the early annihilation of our dietary instinct could, plus a strong cultural psycho-cultural conditioning to do away with the inborn aversion every child experiences.

Scientists have been debating for decades by now, owing to the difficulty of analyzing the lots of dead or alleged drunken birds by forensic pathologists, in order to ascertain common causes of possibly unrelated accidents. One difficulty lies in the variety of species involved<sup id=fnref:5><a href=#fn:5 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>5</a></sup>.<p>That behavior alone, ethanol-induced stupor or not, doesn&rsquo;t seem normal at all. Both populations and needs should be tailored to the quantities and diversity of food, so that animals shouldn&rsquo;t feel any such rush, not to the point of killing themselves, when less ripe fruits exist. If for some reason in tens or hundreds of thousands of years that very parameter (availability of ripe berries) did not change, then birds would adapt to eat less ripe ones. And coevolution - birds spreading seeds by shitting them - would favor species ripening earlier or longer.<br>The fact it didn&rsquo;t happen, means that there used to be enough food so that such selection pressure couldn&rsquo;t increase.<p>In some cases some birds fall back on back on less appealing, <em>too fermented</em> berries, pushing the limit, with deadly consequences. But how much of them is highly debatable and was debated to death, as many such fallen birds have been analyzed, some autopsies demonstrating excess alcohol<sup id=fnref:6><a href=#fn:6 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>6</a></sup>, some not<sup id=fnref:7><a href=#fn:7 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>7</a></sup>.<p>It doesn&rsquo;t take a galaxy-brain to realize that in the past, a mere 50 years ago, urbanization in the US wasn&rsquo;t nearly as extensive and intensive as today.

Every instinct requires a concomitant learning ensuring its correct application.<br>Herring gulls, for example, drop hard prey from heights onto hard ground, to eat the inside, crabs for instance. Young birds up to one year old tend to fail ridiculously: catching in the air what they just dropped, dropping it on water or soft surfaces or do not fly high enough and must repeat. This contributes to the high mortality of this species’ younglings.<p>These feeding instinct behaviors require extremely complex cerebral motor coordination, flexibility involving an ability to learn various behavior patterns depending on prey, soil, wind, competitors. Youngsters have the instinct to try but understanding the relationship between hard surfaces, height and success takes time and often fails.

The same is true for feeding: the instincts are actualized in the key moments of childhood. This notion highlighted by Konrad Lorenz is fundamental for food and love.<p>Thus the very young baby in front of raw food, will immediately have the innate reflex to smell, to open its mouth if the odor is appropriate, and will turn away its head if the odor is not very engaging or even will spit it out. Many parents will attest to this. Within a few weeks, most of them show an interest in meat, and chew to extract the juice because they have no teeth.<p>On the contrary, in the culinary context, an habituation born from the constraint of denatured, industrial or otherwise processed foods, compromises the baby&rsquo;s ability to assimilate the scale of tastes and smells in relation to inner needs. Cooked flavors change very little, because the genetic programming of senses supposes the contact of raw food. Obedience to parents and conditioning through the vintage command <q>finish your plate</q> eventually replace the baby&rsquo;s instincts with eating habits, dietary beliefs and a permanent inner metabolic disorder.<p>The child born raw (or wild animals) on the other hand gets to know his body and its subtle signals by associating pleasure to obeying natural laws and discomfort to disobeying them.<p>Acquiring this natural acuity of smell and proprioception during adulthood is difficult, it requires a lot of discipline, and the application of some rules developed with the years regarding the number of meals, their quantities, some hints of satisfaction or overload, etc. These are all crutches, but absolutely essential ones for all those who hail from a <q>cooked society</q>.</p><a role=presentation target=_blank href=/Images/biology/instinctotherapy_manger_vrai_1re_de_couverture.webp><img src=/Images/biology/instinctotherapy_manger_vrai_1re_de_couverture_hu556bb7d8c6548f43cd2be7335eef415d_9595640_800x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp srcset="/Images/biology/instinctotherapy_manger_vrai_1re_de_couverture_hu556bb7d8c6548f43cd2be7335eef415d_9595640_800x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 800w, /Images/biology/instinctotherapy_manger_vrai_1re_de_couverture_hu556bb7d8c6548f43cd2be7335eef415d_9595640_604x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 604w, /Images/biology/instinctotherapy_manger_vrai_1re_de_couverture_hu556bb7d8c6548f43cd2be7335eef415d_9595640_400x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 400w, /Images/biology/instinctotherapy_manger_vrai_1re_de_couverture_hu556bb7d8c6548f43cd2be7335eef415d_9595640_200x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 200w" loading=lazy alt="First cover of Manger Vrai" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, (max-width: 600px) 50vw, 400px" width=800px height=734px style=--height-limit:734px></a><p>Maternal diet from the moment of conception to the delivery is known for certain now, to impact the child&rsquo;s health for its whole life<sup id=fnref:9><a href=#fn:9 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>9</a></sup>.

I had nervous issues, a dissociative tendency - not to the point of losing my sanity, but just enough to cause severe depression with bulimia-anorexia and the incapacity to concentrate. The bulk of it appeared in a year, while no physician could do a thing, besides giving pills which had no effect, except low-key mimicking a lobotomy.<p>I had the luxury before, to see for myself what those pills could do to people, and wanted none of it so I decided to learn a new <q>diet philosophy</q> for lack of a better term, and I learnt everything else by the same occasion, in the same movement, in a spa of ten years, while my mind broadened, discarding old psychological fixations and taboos.<p>This lack of nervousness compared to the state of mind under a <em>traditional</em> diet cannot be envisioned save by seasoned meditation practitioners for whom the perpetual issue is to carry on
<a href=/en/spirituality/>the calm of their cushion into daily life</a>. <q><em>into the kitchen sink</em></q> as the saying goes. Perhaps the worst place to start !<br>One really has to live it for oneself: the number of situation one feels normally overwhelmed by impressions and emotions in daily life and acting on them or thinking it&rsquo;s a big deal is staggering, it is a new way to go about life, that alone offers nearly for free a peaceful state of mind worth a lifetime of investment in spirituality to most of the time, little to no avail.<p class=important id=def_feedback_effect>This relentless inner turmoil and uncontrollable urges are only chaotic dysfunctions of the brain, excited by the constant influx of denatured molecules coursing your bloodstream, now acknowledged both in their psychogenic effects.<br><strong>We called this the feedback effect</strong>.<p>The case of common <q>excitants</q> and <q>stimulants</q> like coffee and chocolate and <q>anything with too much sugar</q> shouldn&rsquo;t be difficult to consider today, but what if the whole of cooked food acted similarly, arguably much worse ?<br>When everyone is mad, no one is seen as such !<br>Once that most of the <strong>immediate feedback</strong> effect ruining lives and causing all mental issues (save for clear genetic ones like such as Down syndrome&mldr;) subsumes in a month or two in good conditions (or more a few more for serious cases), one is then free to undertake the worse part, that is rewiring one&rsquo;s brain.<p>Because this constant mind poisoning since early babyhood actually wires our brains in a pathological paranoiac (and dissociative) mode that only a long exposure to a balanced nervous state can teach the brain how to react, what to correct. Thus the importance of steadfastness, beyond a simple matter of health:<br>To correct <strong>structural feedback</strong> one needs to see the natural state, one oneself and others, to recalibrate and remember it when we lose it for some reasons. This allows us not to invest in erroneous thoughts, emotions and situations. We learn to laugh at ourselves, and not to take ourselves too seriously.<p>While quickly enough the company of easily triggered normal folk, <q>cooked people</q>, becomes intolerable. We wanna get out of the cavern of shadows, and find <q>real</q> people. The same properly mind-blowing gap is starkly exemplified with animals, which do not have the luxury of that big head of ours and its wonderful though deceptive ability for self-control.<br>But cockerels and pigs fed with (heated) grains and leftovers, routinely attack their peers or females, leading sometimes to an orgy of violence and blood, hence the need to separate males from each other or even from females. The problem is well-known, though the association with dietary conditions, hardly so. In the same vein, niggers skullfuck and eat each others routinely in all of Africa, since time immemorial.<p>On the other hand, wild animals (or domestic animals not fed with $h!t !) act much more harmoniously, tolerate each other and males do not indulge in reckless fights leading to injuries. Some even grow a liking with each other when females lack&mldr; Dogs stop barking ceaselessly at the slightest leaf falling, or for no reason at all.<br>And cats stop hissing loudly and fighting, while trying to copulate. The list of behavior goes on and on, and their exploration and almost infinite ramifications makes for a lot of unique research in all areas, in human or animal sciences.<p>At the same time since less and less things manage to trigger us anymore like a diehard feminists presented with facts, the mind becomes able to approach concepts new and old without the overly gets able to encompass much more thoughts and concepts, hitherto barred from access by subconscious mental blockades, whether born from habits or childhood conditioning.<p>The tendency (no one claims perfection here) goes toward not a dullness of emotions, but actually a richer inner life, more in touch with deeper meanings in life and relationships, not encumbered. As molecular order is restored, cerebral functions improve and the constant fog that followed us all our life - and for many doomed their school efforts - is lifted, granting a higher clarity of mind.<p>Compulsive or obsessional ideas lose their strength, progressively discarded as one comes to terms with their meaninglessness. Things we were taught as <q>evil</q> or diabolical, appear not so bad or at least not a reason to kamikaze oneself for an unseen God and his quite hypothetical houris, burn people to the stake&mldr; or send them to jail for revisionism.

For men, the very nature of the sexual drive shifts from an obsessive, compulsive and very physical need for gratification - the need to jerk off - and enlarges into a more satisfying experience, leading to heighten communication between partners and a keener perception of each other&rsquo;s wants and desires (and ones&rsquo; own !), a clearer perception of reality overall. In fact, while lacking intimacy for too long does erode one&rsquo;s inner peace it never constitutes a physical urgency or urgency anymore, as some autoerotism suffices on that part.<p>We become also increasingly aware of ourselves, notwithstanding or trespassing the barriers of our education and prejudices, or seemingly deep-rooted disgust. From the moment we consciously choose to let go of conceptions of sex and age of partners, we become spontaneously more in tune and approach the natural norms and inner states of mind described by metapsychoanalysis. No more uncontrollable erections: these only rise when the moment calls for their use. No more <q>muh dik</q> ! Men stop seeing women as walking pieces of meat.

Once we decide on a course of action, it is not unusual to continue for hours, until late in the night&mldr; or the morning, technically. Of course the need for sleep doesn&rsquo;t go away, though it does diminish as sleep gets both lighter and restful, depending on persons and state of supply, as with any other trait. So sleep or fatigue in general can stack up a lot, until a day later (or several) one has to clear up one&rsquo;s debt (hardly a healthy practice though).<p>Many other elements hitherto considered perpetual constants of human nature, are products of cooking, mere artifacts of our lifestyle. The idea of an intrinsic human <q>weakness</q> (which would come as a cost of a bigger brain) in comparison to animals goes up in smoke along with the susceptibility to infections and inflammations.<p>The rejection of the germ theory in favor of a new understanding of viral phenomena as symbiotic and beneficial for our health frees the mind and increases the capacity for regeneration, allowing us to live fully without a care in the world.<p>The need for nearly any medicine, save for a few cases of surgery (dentistry and accidents), is no more. In good conditions bruises and hurts, even serious, not only do not hurt at all except on the very moment of injury, but heal up several times faster than a normal person without any disinfectants, barely any care even letting dirt and whatever on the surface, just for the lulz.<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CkWmgL0k00" rel="external nofollow" target=_blank>We develop a heightened healing factor</a>: Impressive doesn&rsquo;t do justice to that kind of feat. We truly enter the realm of superhumans.<p>Blood clotting takes less than a minute at least for life-critical outflows. It appeared that the considered <q>normal</q> levels of pain is not natural but caused by a constant high level of autoinflammation, raging on the smallest occasion. That explains why wounds just do not hurt when let them still and the work to do its work. The body can regenerate damaged internal organs to the extent to cure almost all diseases, and slow down the degenerative part of aging to a significant degree. <strong>We age much better, and slowly, even without training.</strong> Samewise, the amount of flesh that is possible to regrow when still enclosed by sufficient surrounding tissues approaches the healing factor of the likes of lions, healing big wounds healed in no time nor a care in the world.<p>Similarly, those born or at least raised on raw food will never worry anymore about tooth decay. Wild animals with a balance diet do not develop caries, and it wasn&rsquo;t uncommon for people before WW2 to never have a single cavity in their entire life, simply because we started eating so much shit only with the economic boom that followed.<p>Those two points together make for a much higher tolerance for grueling training, while better quality muscles coming from natural proteins (insects, shellfish, wild game, nuts) ensure a more resilient body which doesn&rsquo;t tend to break down nearly as much: therefore we can take much more punishment to get back on feet quicker, with a <strong>zenkai boost</strong>. But this wasn&rsquo;t explored nearly as much as it should considering an even more surprising realization: <strong>training proved useless in so far as keeping in shape is concerned</strong>. Animals are basically born with rippling muscles and maintain them regardless of training, as long as they have good quality food: May they slacken as they please, they do not fatten.<figure class=center><figcaption><strong>Men on the other hand, are known to lose muscles without constant exercising.</strong></figcaption><a class=center role=presentation target=_blank href=/Images/memes/chad_traditional_food_preparing_woman.webp><img src=/Images/memes/chad_traditional_food_preparing_woman_huf4a3b88d4f7fd1d0f818e258fbbd887d_904442_800x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp srcset="/Images/memes/chad_traditional_food_preparing_woman_huf4a3b88d4f7fd1d0f818e258fbbd887d_904442_800x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 800w, /Images/memes/chad_traditional_food_preparing_woman_huf4a3b88d4f7fd1d0f818e258fbbd887d_904442_604x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 604w, /Images/memes/chad_traditional_food_preparing_woman_huf4a3b88d4f7fd1d0f818e258fbbd887d_904442_400x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 400w, /Images/memes/chad_traditional_food_preparing_woman_huf4a3b88d4f7fd1d0f818e258fbbd887d_904442_200x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 200w" loading=lazy alt="Parodic modification of a meme normally praising traditional gender role and cooking, to promote instead innate ape&rsquo;s superior strength acquired with raw food" title="**Men on the other hand, are known to lose muscles without constant exercising.**" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, (max-width: 600px) 100vw, 70vw" width=800px height=453px style=--height-limit:453px></a></figure><p>Men eating cooked food that is. It appeared obvious that this was no design of ours but a degenerated state with autoimmunity plus low-quality proteins constantly breaking down our body which loses shape. With a good instincto diet, even a potato crouch will never accumulate fat but stick to a low to very low percentage though never down to a dangerous level. It doesn&rsquo;t mean either a loss of reserve: fasting a few days is no big deal.<p class=important>It appears the body can and should regulate both the muscle and fat level to an optimal staturo-ponderal equilibrium.<p>It might range from being slim to getting ripped for almost effort, depending on how long you ate traditional before and what (seasoned salads or Big Macs ?) made the transition. The more those molecules stay inside you, the longer all the processes mentioned in this text take long before acting their full power. That means people <q>born raw</q>, as we saw, do not need any exercise and develop splendid tough muscles, including girls. Therefore, a potent benefit of the raw paleo diet is to <strong>get jacked and hot</strong>.<p>And maintain that physique for much longer as well: aging slowing down, we keep a slim/athletic physique as long as we keep a varied enough diet to continue on the cleansing process, and most of all if we keep clear from excessive animal meat, especially domestic meat which proved degenerative sometimes even more raw than cooked, as less damaged molecules bypasses the immune system more and in the end cause more autoimmunity. Excess proteins do the same as unnatural proteins, and shorten lifespan, eating away at our healing factor.<p>The best part of our lifeforce is constantly undermined and spent on fighting off the autoimmunity caused by cooked molecules. That&rsquo;s why you would find no <q>prescription</q> nor medicinal drugs, nothing special to do than to follow one&rsquo;s instinct to a T, and certainly artificial nothing to take. While some herbs or plants may or do have special properties, they are nothing in isolation and would prove detrimental when issued out of intellectual considerations.<p>Infections and dangerous viral episodes become an outright impossibility and decades of experiences taught us that no genetically healthy wild animal (among vertebrates at least) that has not been polluted by denatured molecules, should be prey to microbes present in his natural environment.<p class=important><strong>Years showed the complete eradication of infectious diseases and cancers alike</strong> when the latter are not too advanced. Even then, it allows for a painless death with full mental faculties and no medication.<p>To replace the prevailing germ theory, from the basis of our experiences and the observation of animals and the circumstances in which diseases arise, Guy‑Claude Burger created a revolutionary new theory of diseases, pathogens of all kinds (viruses, fungi, bacteria and parasites) and their relation to health.<p>We called this the <strong>exogenetic command theory</strong>, in which each layer of complexity in the realm of life, are under the genetic and molecular command of the layer above. We do not fight <q>pathogens</q>, we do not cohabit with them in a symbiotic relationships like equals in a partnership. Our genetics commands them, using them to improve the molecular order of our organisms: clean us and as well as share information in our stead.<p>Viruses, bacteria and multicellular parasites, at least those we meet in our natural environment (with a wide margin over &ldquo;natural&rdquo;) serve the need of animal and vegetal species, keeping them fit and genetically strong and partaking in the horizontal transfer of genetic material throughout the whole ecosystem, as recognized today.<p>In this framework, the definition of life needs to be amended, as it stands to reason that the classical criteria (reproduction, metabolism - difference between the outside and inside compartment - and a response to external stimulus) do not matter in this context, as teleology (expected <strong>purpose</strong> within a system) information and effect. <dfn>life</dfn>
should be considered as an enclosed system of information, ultimately including the whole ecosystem, air land and ocean.<p>There also entails profound repercussions as the theory of evolution, hinting at kinds of selective pressures acting on species or groups of them, not out of isolated elements of the natural environment but of the planet:<br>Since the latter could be considered as <q>alive</q> even by modern standards (tweaking them just a little) without even considering the spiritual aspect it may as well possess a <q>will</q>, expressed as the mathematical integral of all individual interactions, processed through what could be a global neural network. The purpose of this system would be (obviously) to stay alive, hence maintaining global conditions conducive to life through its own means and the agency of its constitutive parts, both biotic and abiotic.<p>While high-end, these speculative ideas aren&rsquo;t that strange nor new, and with the discovery of a reproducible source of reliable extrasensory phenomena, do come across as fairly natural, intuitive.<br><strong>What is the new though</strong>, is the application of the virus theory as <strong>the most ancient and prevalent means to transfer horizontally information in the form of genetic material</strong>, across individuals and ultimately <strong>widely across the species barrier</strong>. Such a tool, existing since the dawn of life while not itself living (<strong>lacking the characteristic of a metabolism</strong>), would be the preferred means of communication inside the system, and its means to influence its components on an evolutionary scale, much like hormones.<p>Such dynamics are readily apparent in our body as we known now it conveys orders to all the living cells it contains including its bacterial population (of a relative, 39 vs 30 trillions) through viruses: Human Endogenous (retro)viruses,
<a href=/en/viral_phenomenon/#exosomes>exosomes</a> and bacteriophages (which target viruses), helping to control microbial populations, not only by stopping their propagation but redirect, favor or extinguish species or whole genera. What if such processes were also happening on a vastly different scale, by the Earth on its denizen species ?<p>On a smaller scale, parasitism - and sometimes epidemics - is an undeniable fact of <q>nature</q>, even in <q>wild</q> animals (though not as much as for domesticated species, cattle etc). Epidemics indeed can be seen in the animal world, animals do fall prey to parasites, to various levels. While others don&rsquo;t&mldr; but still carry the pathogens ? The scientific world doesn&rsquo;t understand those variations of sensibility and blame genetics whenever it is convenient, to force reality into their prey-predator model generalized to all microbes, parasites, viruses, etc, like forcing a square peg into round holes.<br>Parasites are supremely varied and numerous, indicating either extremely successful competitors in the battle of life&mldr; or that they fill a crucial role in ecological equilibriums. Parasites are a powerful agent of natural selection on a molecular or physiological level, perhaps greatest that all other factors like predation. That is what biologists now think. This much we do not deny. <strong>However</strong>:<br>If the role of parasites and viruses is to weed out the weak and diseased, the degenerates. Keeping the population fit. The question is, how many <q>weak</q> individuals is a natural population - in a pristine natural setting - supposed to carry, what should be its <strong>mean parasitic load</strong> ? At what level is the balance attained ?<p>The answer depends on two things:<ul><li>What species are we talking about ?<li>Are the parasites out for themselves and <strong>fighting</strong> against us, or do <strong>we</strong> actually control them well for our own profit, as long as we fit within the genetic and physiologic norms for a given species ?</ul><p>In our experience for mammals parasites (such as tenias) are always regulated. A few days of disciplined instincto suffices to expel in mass any and all resident worms, big or small, through feces, <strong>in animals (pets) and humans alike</strong>. Rawpaleodiet practitioners have sojourned in African countries ridden with malaria-infected mosquitoes, none caught the disease except one - Guy‑Claude himself - <strong>who thought smart to mix food out of frustration</strong>. None of his twenty companions.<p>It appeared clear that humans could survive uniquely long with a terribly poor cooked diet. Our resilience and ability to maintain a semblance of health - something of an inner balance - seemed to have evolved further than for any other animals, including chimpanzees, who simply die with cooked fruits, in a short time.<p>However pets and cattle were also seen capable of gradually eliminating culinary toxins from its body, having similar though less potent mechanisms of molecular exchange when provided with equivalent natural molecules. In short, with all mammals and birds (having no experience with fish) we fed well (ensuring a varied choice not too dissimilar with what they could find on their own in the wild) ever had <strong>any</strong> issue with epidemics, parasites, nothing. This reality we can not deny, yet it is not the one specialists encounter in the wild.<br>How to explain cases like this one:<blockquote><p>Ommatokoita elongata is a 30 mm (1.2 in) long pinkish-white parasitic copepod, frequently found permanently attached to the corneas of the Greenland shark and Pacific sleeper shark. The parasites cause severe visual impairment,</blockquote><p>Or the world-wide scourge of toxoplasmosis in rabbits and hare, also significantly hurting dolphins in the sea, and cats in our house. And cats&rsquo; owners too. In all of these species, at least locally the disease&rsquo;s prevalence and loss of fitness it incurs are high (a big proportion of the population can be infected and show symptoms). Albeit less intelligent than us cats and rabbits are all highly evolved vertebrates, <strong>sharing basically the same immune system</strong>. This applies obviously all the more to dolphins, in some regards more evolved than us and having a similar lifespan. I believe the presence of a complex <strong>adaptative</strong> immune system is the key to differentiate <q>lower</q> lifeforms which tend to die whenever they are polluted (or genetically unfit) to whatever degree, quickly to be replaced by a fitter population.<p>Such species would need to breed very fast, in large numbers, and typically live short lives. Bacterias being a good exemple, most plants too. Individuals, in those species, do not matter one bit, and the species happily discards them for the greater good. However it seems that the more complex and adaptive the immune system is, the more a species doesn&rsquo;t need anymore, to discard individuals, instead their capacity to discard the source of the pollution within themselves (either metabolic waste or in our case an inordinate amount of heat-denatured molecules) grows. Ecologically, animals with higher lifespans are more likely to show advanced immune systems as losing individuals for a species (always of slow-breeders) is actually dramatic, an important blow. A species of long-lived, slow-breeders can only be maintained with rather powerful adaptive immune systems, and the ability

While our understanding of mammals has reached perfection in this respect, more experiences and studies need to be done with fish, crustaceans, insects, etc, which seemingly possess a much, much wider breadth of variation than we see within vertebrates.

Why such a gross amplification (timidly called &ldquo;rescaling&rdquo;) should be legit when the spurt is not only visible for humans with mere linear plotting but often drastic ?<p>The juvenile phase exists in all intelligent social animals, which makes sense given its obvious learning function. This is the most dangerous period for postneonatal mortality. Incidentally, note here significant differences between Africans and Asians/Europeans. There are two basic ways to get from infancy to adulthood. One is to develop quickly and minimize the duration of the nonreproductive period between weaning and sexual maturation. The other strategy is to develop toward adulthood slowly, increasing the time for learning and producing higher quality adults.<p>What we call &ldquo;traditional demographic regime&rdquo; (free sexual activity and no contraceptives nor modern medicine) is described as &ldquo;high stationary&rdquo;, because <strong>understandably</strong> Such parameters give rise to a very high birth rate, 4 to 8 deliveries per woman in the Middle Age but only because of the custom of marrying late in your 20s, several years past sexual maturity or even the fertility peak, and other regulatory practices. Backward African countries bent on maximizing natality show us the expected result in nature with constant intercourse, as per our instincts, which is an excess of 7 children, up to 12, without multiple births.<p>The only reason this regime is called &ldquo;high stationary&rdquo;, is because this high nativity is compensated by an equally high <em>infant mortality, plus wars and famines</em>: all factors leaving no traces before the Neolithic revolution, and that could not have existed before cooking. That means that in absence of social regulations of matrimony, a people whose food is somewhat rawer, somewhat more vital and richer in vitamins, thus enjoying a good health and no epidemics, around the level of the
<a href=/en/viral_phenomenon/#truncated-lifespans-and-mental-diseases>least disturbed chimpanzees</a> <strong>would witness an explosive demographic growth</strong>.<p>This alone suffices to reveal a horrifying error in our biology. Evolution made us apex, for millions of years, before even our divergence from fellow apes. Thus a monstrous fertility makes no sense. That&rsquo;s why an innate ecological sense must evolve for species like ours, let them destroy their environment and themselves in the process <em>as is happening ever faster</em>. And since animals do not take well-thought-out &ldquo;rational decisions&rdquo;, we are obviously talking of unconscious mechanisms, animals have no awareness of.<p><em>Without diseases and infantile mortality to compensate</em>, a default natality of more than 3 children on average suffices to cause a net demographic growth, and be ecologically unsustainable. Species like ours need to measure and curtail its reproduction to fit the bearing capacity of its environment, as shown by meerkats and wolves for instance&mldr; and chimpanzees. Otherwise, because the environment is neither infinitely flexible or abundant, until groups must contend with increasing stress and dearth of food, endangering everyone&rsquo;s health and so the survival of the group. Despite no ape being a seasonal breeder properly speaking (we are fertile all year long) in both chimpanzees and hunter-gatherer populations, birth peaks are known to coincide with periods of food abundance, not only from season to season but year to year as well<sup id=fnref:18><a href=#fn:18 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>18</a></sup>.<p>A hard-boiled belief in the scientific community is that all species would tend to produce as many offspring as possible given available resources, and would fill the environment if predators or other environmental constraints disappeared<sup id=fnref:19><a href=#fn:19 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>19</a></sup>. Some species <em>require</em> predation to maintain the ecological balance, on which many other animals or plants depend, including those they feed on. The point of life is to survive, not to increase beyond measure. And an unlimited multiplication would lead to the destruction of the environment, as we realize this bitterly today.<p id=interbirth><strong>Let us look at the weaning/interbirth time variable</strong>: because chimpanzees basically mate constantly (like we do), despite a dominance of lesbian relationships most females are either pregnant, or with a child. So what delays one pregnancy from the other, <em>is only the time taken for the offspring to wean</em>.<br>How to calculate this for humans ?<br>In the US a fourth of all babies start out with baby formula, and half are given it by the 6th month, so people <em>hardly ever</em> breastfeed more than a year, against an average of <strong>5 kids</strong> in wild chimpanzees. But it <em>wouldn&rsquo;t matter</em> because today, with a &ldquo;rich&rdquo; diet breastfeeding <strong>only acts as a contraceptive for the first six month</strong>. And it is said that the LAM (breastfeeding) method only works if milk is the only food but this is not the case for chimpanzees, as from experience in just a few days infants smell and eat all kinds of food including meat, simply squeezing juices out of it for lack of chewing instruments.<p>The replacement rate for
<a href=fallen#predation_negligeable>great apes</a> is low, around 5, because of infant mortality (and taking into account the rare accidents) but in humans experience showed this reduced to zero. So in our case, <strong>more than 3 would be an ecological catastrophe</strong>. Yet even if the inter-birth time had not dwindled and we had to wait 5 years between births, considering a fertility window of 30 years <em>this would still leave room for a minimum of 5 children</em>.<p id=menstruation>With our diet menstruations disappear entirely in a few months without any adverse effect on fertility, as well as the famous pain of childbirth, after a year. The strong tendency for inflammation or autoimmunity caused by a permanent influx of denatured cooked molecules also disappears, releasing a treasure of bodily capabilities and resistance to muscle and psychological stress of all kinds. With time (more or less years depending on the choice of food) the tissues rebuild themselves on a stronger and more durable healthy basis.<figure><figcaption>Lilith</figcaption><a role=presentation target=_blank href=/Images/spirituality/mythology/lilith.webp><img src=/Images/spirituality/mythology/lilith.webp srcset="/Images/spirituality/mythology/lilith.webp 637w, /Images/spirituality/mythology/lilith_hu8aa8dbd59d705acf5e66ad89145d2f8c_633458_604x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 604w, /Images/spirituality/mythology/lilith_hu8aa8dbd59d705acf5e66ad89145d2f8c_633458_400x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 400w, /Images/spirituality/mythology/lilith_hu8aa8dbd59d705acf5e66ad89145d2f8c_633458_200x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 200w" loading=lazy alt=Lilith title=Lilith sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, (max-width: 600px) 50vw, 400px" width=637px height=1200px style=--height-limit:1200px></a></figure><p>It is well known that captive animals develop significantly faster, breed faster and have shorter times of lactation per offspring, and shorter ovulation cycles.

We can almost talk of a transition from a K to a r breeding strategy. A gradual cessation of fertility appears in all species, but except in ours it narrows down to a few years death, <em>matching overall health</em>.

Several doctors attribute this delay in puberty to the arduous work to which girls from the countryside are subjected. They are aware of the city/country differences and grant a certain influence to the “passions” which agitate city dwellers earlier. It is the climate, finally affirms the doctor from Bourg‑Saint‑Andéol, which explains the advance in puberty of the girls of this small town. The climate hypothesis dominated the discourse on puberty for a long time. There is a certain astonishment among these doctors: ultimately, the late age of menarche seems to them to be an anomaly, pointing to a poor economic and health situation. However, some are reassured, this late puberty does not prevent high fertility; in some cases, <em>the late age at first menstruation can be compensated by also late menopause</em>, which extends the period of fertility.<p>&ldquo;Pale colors&rdquo; are often associated with those girls in the moment of their period. But since these children are nevertheless always <em>strong and healthy</em>, we can assume that <em>this “delay” in constitution does not correspond to a lack of development, but to a natural state</em>. It is not malnutrition. On the contrary, these observations show that physical strength, the strength of an adult, is unrelated to maturing as an adult. In a sense children used to grow tall, but not old, or very, very slowly.<p>Even then, the label of malnutrition (and being &ldquo;<em>
underweight
</em>&rdquo; often sticks to what are simply children growing at a more natural rate, or not as fat as nearly everyone is today. And could we deem “pathological” a reduced fertility, when the norm is absolutely unsustainable from an ecological standpoint ?<br>So, late periods correlate with a less abundant onslaught of denatured molecules<br>Idle children from the city age faster and <em>weaker</em>. This comes from the accumulation of denatured molecules, in the same way that puberty conditions the appearance of pimples etc: a growth which occurs stops seeing the toxins concentrate and require additional outlets. Additionally an urban setting offers more abundant and more processed food, more meat among other things.<br>These analyses were clearly underpinned by a “populationist” concern, emerging during this second half of the 18th century8. In the speeches of doctors before the Revolution, we read about all the supposed factors which influence the age at menarche, except the <strong>food factor which is not put forward</strong>, at least in these texts addressed to the Society royal medicine.<p>Food is questioned in the 19th century but in the opposite direction to common sense: despite the fact that women could produce <strong>fifteen</strong> children for the authorities it was still not enough, pushing them to introduce wine to richer food. Illustrating their fall into materialism, Revolutionaries and Republicans became obsessed with making women breed the most and the soonest possible.<br>However, the changes took time to be observed, perhaps because the added foods (wine, meat?) did not constitute very significant factors of disorder, unlike the foods which formerly characterized the cities compared to the countryside: sugar white, chocolate, complicated ready meals, etc<sup id=fnref:23><a href=#fn:23 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>23</a></sup>. In time peasants would eat at the same table as the nobles of yester century<sup id=fnref:24><a href=#fn:24 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>24</a></sup>.<br>Some physicians however, having more common sense, understood perfectly that later menarche is the sign of a more robust constitution, giving a better health and was often accompanied by a late menopause<sup id=fnref:25><a href=#fn:25 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>25</a></sup>.<p>Mirroring what we see in apes, we believe menopause (anticipated cessation of fertility) simply <strong>should not exist</strong>. It makes no sense evolutionarily speaking and does not get corroborated in other primates<sup id=fnref:26><a href=#fn:26 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>26</a></sup>. Though we lacked the occasion to observe it yet, considering how well we saw people age, we should at least expect women to stay fertile in their 70s. Such women would look much more attractive and young than the grandmas of today, easily 20 years younger, so it would really not be such a stretch.<p>While wild apes have very little bleeding - much less than we do - women under instinctotherapy had <em>absolutely none</em>. Yet had no issue getting pregnant <strong>when desired</strong>. Ovulations include symptoms such as cramps, an increase in

The higher the life expectancy, the lower the frequency of childbirth must be in absence of external regulation lest for the population to explode then die from the depletion of their food source. The latter may happen with some inferior animals in some ecological contexts, but all higher animals, especially predators (or generally non-preys) display behavioral mechanisms to that effect.<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t the conscious control of procreation be the continuation of what seems already nascent in our cousins, the complete subordination of reproduction to the metapsychic instinctive program ?<br>While lutein levels could not be measured (to ascertain the absence of ovulation), women can know by other hints too, physical and nervous.

Thus cooking, by outsourcing part of our digestion, would have allowed us to waste less time and energy eating, devoting these resources to developing our brain<sup id=fnref:29><a href=#fn:29 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>29</a></sup> and properly human symbolic activities.<br>R.

Not really.<br>Simply a fire nurtured with food remains of the last meal. However, it illustrates well the ease with which the overwhelming majority of specialists (and common folk) just can&rsquo;t separate fire from cooking. First, I would like to make a point about the state of meat consumed in nature. The idea that cooking is necessary for the digestion of raw meat comes mainly from the fact that we imagine a fresh leg of lamb with the consistency of rubber.<p class=important>In reality, meat only becomes edible - and much better digested than in the cooked state -
<a href=maturation_faisandage_en>when it is allowed to age</a>.<p>If a prehistoric man used fire but did not cook, what did he use it for ? Several hypotheses can be put forward:<ol class=col_2><li>to scare animals at night to sleep in peace (especially since we no longer sleep in trees)<li>to light up<li>to keep warm</ol><p>We believe that in nature, fire has never been more than an accessory for our ancestors, whose body and brain were perfectly adapted to not only survive but thrive. So none of the listed reasons hold.This is not to say that fire does not warm or light. But we just did not need it. Our natural abilities are ensured in all environments). Most people, including scientists, think fire instinctively scares all animals&mldr; This is wrong. Try it in the African savannah and the next day you might be missing a few toes, with the compensation of having caused a nice indigestion to a lioness or hyena: because these intelligent animals are not afraid of fire.<p>Of course they avoid it and know its danger, but a fire that is neither too big nor too fast will not worry them at all. The same goes for wolves and bears. Most animals flee from humans, and it is proven that it is the human presence behind the fire that discourages them&mldr; but that also means that if you do nothing special to keep them away, they would not come. On the contrary, some will be attracted by the smell, and if they smell something they like they will come and help themselves. So it&rsquo;s habitual behavior: they will come all the more if they recognize the human presence and associate it with food. But there is more: fire often indicates cooking so the particular smell will have the same effect of fascination on animals as it has on us. Fire is very well-known not to repeal animals but attract them, which in the case of bears is <strong>bad news</strong>.<p>Lastly we are not natural prey for any animal. Neither sharks nor tigers will instinctively pounce on us until they are starved to death&mldr; or drugged by the denatured molecules. Numbers alone would deter predators interested in your children or pets, more than fire can. Also, don&rsquo;t expect to keep mosquitoes away either. There is very little reality behind the common picture of weak prehistorical men only surviving the assault of cruel wild beasts with the product of his brain.</p><a class=center role=presentation target=_blank href=/Images/biology/tapetum_lucidum_bandeau.webp><img src=/Images/biology/tapetum_lucidum_bandeau_huf3178569eaf4f495379144c8eccd61e7_504640_800x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp srcset="/Images/biology/tapetum_lucidum_bandeau_huf3178569eaf4f495379144c8eccd61e7_504640_800x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 800w, /Images/biology/tapetum_lucidum_bandeau_huf3178569eaf4f495379144c8eccd61e7_504640_604x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 604w, /Images/biology/tapetum_lucidum_bandeau_huf3178569eaf4f495379144c8eccd61e7_504640_400x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 400w, /Images/biology/tapetum_lucidum_bandeau_huf3178569eaf4f495379144c8eccd61e7_504640_200x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 200w" loading=lazy alt="Image de tapetum lucidum" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, (max-width: 600px) 100vw, 70vw" width=800px height=195px style=--height-limit:195px></a><p>As for lighting, of course, we are not cats, we do not have a tapetum lucidum which reflects light behind their pupils.

The consumption of cereals may of course be older. I am of the opinion that cooking must have appeared several times in several places, more or less accidentally, because consequent control and taking thousands of years to develop, allowed sufficient food security to concentrate populations in sedentary centers, contrary to what has always been the case. This article may point to an early, if short-lived, establishment of cooking and cereals<sup id=fnref:30><a href=#fn:30 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>30</a></sup>.<p>One can conceive cooking must have fascinated relatively primitive populations in terms of intelligence, <em>once a certain brain size threshold was reached, say, 800 cm³ perhaps</em>. But groups falling prey to this lack of instinctive programming against the product of our own intelligence, soon would degenerate physically, devoured by predators (as happening with Bengali tigers) or supplanted by other healthier human groups, either breeding them out of existence or slaughtering them as an act of mercy.<p>Studies (and the experience of any animal breeder or farmer whatsoever since the beginning of husbandry) supports the universal preference or addicting effect that light <em>controlled</em> cooking is <em>intrinsically attractive</em> to animals<sup id=fnref:31><a href=#fn:31 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>31</a></sup>.

That process happened automatically, as the faster the disorder, the easier one could make the association with said recipe. On the other hand, even a 100% chance of getting cancer or kidney failure 30 years after, is very unlikely to occasion any change. Such is the shortsightedness of the masses, <em>in particular when addiction kicks in</em>.<p>That all might explain, why only humans practice cooking willingly, despite a few animals having the intelligence to try it enough to <em>overcome the instinctive repulsion and get hooked</em>.

Such is the natural order, the beauty of natural selection, whose remnants haven&rsquo;t totally disappeared from the sanest human cultures.<p>After all, it was still customary in ancient Greece, though relatively cultured people, to immediately eliminate monsters and mutants at birth, any <em>abnormal</em> child. Many animals also have the impulse to reject abnormal individuals from the herd, and mothers to kill such young. It doesn&rsquo;t take much imagination to imagine the reaction of a healthy group meeting a half sick, half excited cooking group. From the point of view of natural selection, a genocidal behavior would make perfect sense.<p>Then as hominids reached a threshold in intelligence, we came able to repeat the mistake intentionally, and not live long enough afterwards to make babies&mldr; unfortunately cooking
<a href=/en/meta/>increases fertility at all levels</a>, chemically, psychologically and socially, setting breeding instincts on overdrive on a biological level. So we can expect that after a certain population threshold, the health detriments would be offset and cooked groups would start breeding more than naturally, replacing others, eventually forcing them to intermarry due to the sheer pressure. Our intelligence conjugated with the unexpected effect on our nervous system, would have allowed individually sick individuals to gang up and survive, then take over.<p>That is Mr Burger&rsquo;s take.

A true polymath. But among the most chilling, awe-inspiring pieces of gold one can find in his <q>Table Talks</q>, are his numerous attacks on cooking. I laid them here, they deserve praise and comments when put in perspective in the light of our instinctive diet experiences several decades after, how remarkable he was there too, even if he wasn&rsquo;t always the first to make them.<ul><li>Hitler stated loudly the harmfulness of cooking in itself<li>our extreme minimization of meat (animal in particular) would have met his unlimited approval as well.</ul><p>Without a shadow of a doubt, a victorious Germany would have embraced instinctotherapy with open arms. Instead, decades after the war however gains in lifespan came nearly entirely from modern medicine, while <em>constitutional health</em> steadily decreased as indicated by the slow reduction for about 30 years of the <dfn tooltip="Average number of  years a person can expect to live in full health, that is without suffering from disabling or debilitating illnesses">health-adjusted life expectancy</dfn>
&mdash;or &ldquo;healthspan&rdquo;&mdash;and the heightened tendency to get sick, to quickly lose teeth without at least semi-regular dentist check-ups (an issue rare before WW2).<p><em>We may come to the point, where the most advanced medical clutches can not compensate anymore for our organisms&rsquo; rate of degradation</em>. What could happen for our current generation, if the medical infrastructure were to fail, due to EMPs, or a shortage of oil (vital to produce drugs) due to geopolitical reasons, or a global economic crisis ?<p>We saw the confirmation of those early intuitions: all but the most advanced terminal stage cancers proved remissible, in so far as people access a wide variety of food and stick to discipline as if their life depended on it&mldr; Because it really does. But usually people at such a stage, or before for that matter, like for AIDS, reject the most wondrous signs of healing to keep cooking, even when it comes with the come-back of symptoms, and near-certitude of death. It has been said that cancers can be fought back with the will to live: this can&rsquo;t possibly negate the reality of feeding shit to your body thrice a day, but at the same, we know for a fact that such a will is decidedly rare in most people, some desire - <q>to fit in</q> in a social group - <em>can and do override the most basic instincts, that of survival, no question asked</em>.<p>While Hitler was wrong in rejecting meat wholesale or that children would never hunt instinctively (we saw them do just that, with delight and without weapon), meat absolutely has very limited appeal for healthily calibrated bodies. I mean that it can be delicious, the best food in the world - as <em>all</em> food should be if they smell the best - but very rarely so, once in a while, a few times per month at best, and more so fish or reptiles.<br>I am not aware of Hitler&rsquo;s opinion of fish and seafood in general, let alone insects. Wild raw meat is no poison, and the body will definitely default to it for a significant amount of time if need be, however to conclude that the Ice Age made cooking a necessity is a fallacy: Many Ice Ages and Interglacials succeeded for the better part of the last million years. It stands to reason we adapted to them.<p>Moreover, people used to <em>move, a lot</em>: why on Earth would a tribe stay at a place with nothing to eat but animals which quickly enough would prove unsavory, relatively costly to catch compared to fruits, and weakening your folk the longer you keep on such an unbalanced diet (as proved by Inuits, until recently total raw foodists yet age very fast) ? <em>Animals would flee. But super-intelligent big-brained primates would not ?</em><p>As I said, we underestimate the amount of food a wild forest would provide, mostly because we ceased to live in them and maintain our ecological role in this obligate co-dependent symbiosis when we started cooking, so even dense forests are no <q>primate forests</q> anymore. In the span of a few millennia, we <em>must</em> eat fruits for them to persist, through our feces, since beside bears (that we proceeded to genocide) no other animal in Europe presents the same balanced, omnivorous range of appeals plus active metabolic needs as us. Lastly, I strongly believe paleoclimatic modelization (let alone vulgarization material) is vastly erroneous , painting a picture of the Ice Age as a kind of barren, sterile no-man&rsquo;s land frozen half of the year. This could not be further from the truth.<p>Ice ages are defined by winter cold enough compared to hotter seasons, so that ice does not thaw entirely, but either sustain itself or pile-up over the years. A good part of Swedes, in particular the edges of hills and mountains, are in that situation, and forests do not shy from nearing glaciers. The same occurs in Switzerland, owing to its topology. It is a matter of temperature <strong>averages</strong>, and most of Sweden isn&rsquo;t barren half the year, but features summers hot enough to get naked comfortably.<br>The part of Europe not under glaciers knew climates varying between modern day Sweden, Switzerland or Norway, with inland masses (and coastal areas, depending microclimates) had a lot more of the typical <strong>continental</strong> climate (unlike the current <strong>temperate</strong> one), with strong winters and <dfn tooltip="Summer in Moscow are warm with moderate temperatures: the warmest months are usually June, July and August with average highs of around 24ºC or 75ºF and lows of 13ºC or 55ºF">warm summers</dfn>
as if suddenly placing France into Ukraine or Poland, or Russia for more Northern places. One could hardly call those regions deserts.<p>Beside, the idea circulates that paleolithic men were ubiquitists able to thrive in any sort of environment but mainly inhabiting <strong><a tooltip="Paleoecological and genetic evidence for Neanderthal power locomotion as an adaptation to a woodland environment (2019)" href=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2018.12.023 rel="external nofollow" target=_blank>woody forests</a></strong>. Then how to explain that most H-G populations, like North-American Indians, prefer meat when possible ? Excluding Inuits - who eat raw and have literally nothing else - we think cooked food is a potent drug. Cereals, as mentioned earlier, but where agriculture can not (or has not yet) developed <strong>the most appealing food source is cooked meat</strong>.<p>Although it is true that places where one has to eat animal food a priori also produce less of what we primates like, it still seems that people relying on meat quickly lose the ability to eat a lot of plant-based food, and their population get to correlate with animal population density, leading to a very inefficient and irrational use of the available resource, as confirmed by studies of hunter-gatherers populations<sup id=fnref:33><a href=#fn:33 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>33</a></sup>.<br>Logic would entail that wherever you are on Earth, whatever the climate, you should eat more plants when they are available and more meat (or seafood) in the non-growing season. What we see is a nett shift in <dfn tooltip="The trophic level of an organism is the position it occupies in a food web.

The menstrual flow which in the girls of Achères does not appear very early continues until the age of 50 and 55, which means that they are fertile for a very long time; <em>It is also not uncommon to see women aged 40 to 45 become mothers, something that is not commonly observed in large cities where menstruation begins at 12 or 13 and disappears between 40 and 45</em>.<br>It follows that it is a real advantage for the population that the menstrual flow does not establish too early. <strong>Moreover, we would be very mistaken if we considered early menstruation as the product of a more robust constitution, or a particular development of the genital organs.

It appears that the end of chemical disturbance of the brain gives access to a greatly appeased state of consciousness, which has proved to be our natural state. Sexual impulses calm down, ending the rule of the so-called hormonal pressure, the imperious physiological need to <strong>fuck</strong> all suffer from, men in particular.<br>In this context meta­psychoanalysis emerged: A theory overturning all human psychology and materialism and demonstrating the systematic apparition of extrasensory faculties such as visions of the past, present or future and telepathy. It postulates (as supported by observations of primates and dolphins) that the primary function of the (natural) sexual impulses is not reproduction but the creation and exchange of a <q>numinous</q> energy to access these abilities reliably.<p><em>This paradigmatic shift in our very perception of reality could be the foundation of a new science at last growing out of its materialistic diapers.</em><br>We do not make the claim that psychic abilities are real&mldr; others already

Like today&rsquo;s feminists pinning for filthy swarthy Middle Easterners or Negroes. Or hundreds years ago, with Jewish or Muslim women eagerly going for Christians. To us this incredible and irrational phenomena (for racial strangers <em>fuck</em> much worse than sensitive White men, quite systematically so) merely reflects the age-old longing for greener pastures, for exoticism, itself predicated on an unfulfilled desire which lies beyond the sex act itself (for men always also fantasized about foreigners from the West Indies in particular, and now Chinese and Japanese).<p>As long as sexuality doesn&rsquo;t fulfill its most important role - that is to provide both orgasmic and metapsychic satisfaction - the race and the State will never be safe from the threat of racial contamination, stemming from within.<p>For centuries, under the terrifying, woefully oppressive yoke of the Catholic Church, people were more sexually free and happy than we are. They never forgot that pleasure comes mostly from the foreskin in the case of men, and only from the <strong>clitoris</strong> in the case of women. Sodomy might have been viewed as devilish, but it was practiced just as much according to the records, and without repercussion in most cases. They knew how to please themselves, be pleased and please others, and did so guilt-free.<p>Once young people know what to do and what to expect of a real love life, they will be free to seek their own happiness, and not be deceived or resign in accepting a miserable fate within the confines of a frustrating marital relation.<p>But even <q>liberated</q> heterosexual women who do take care of their orgasms, aren&rsquo;t necessarily happy, nor they do find a sense of completion, drive and enthusiasm for life, any more than men do. <em>Something is lacking in sex, regardless of the amount we get</em>.<p>As for men, they quickly loose interest in a body they went in more than a few times and quickly enough needs more and more variety in lovemaking with ridiculous positions that change nothing, down to the grotesques range of sex-toys and degrading exposition of anatomical oddities porn movies are full of today.

While their science laged behind ours - obviously - relying on the supernatural (for explanations or help) did not necessarily come as a clutch to supplement their loosy intellect.

While the norm for our closest cousins and many top-tier species regards to intelligence (cetaceans),is more than
<a href=/en/homonazi/#majority_homo>70% of contacts being homosexual</a>, which means that all individuals have on the regular contacts with both sex, and means a 100% bisexual population. This huge and almost planetary discrepancy, comes from this forceful rerouting of all polymorphic urges and libido into breeding behaviors, namely coitus.<p>There is no question about the blatant excess of heterosexuality in our species due to exciting substances, first and foremost denatured molecules, aka cooking. Decades of observations showed the significant direct effect of cooking in ramping up animal baser animal impulses, among them heterosexual desire in particular coital fantasies. The reason being these fantasies are not merely acquired conditioning but instinctive impulses recorded in the deepest depths of our brain and DNA and appeared along our phylogenetic line before homosexual (or polymorphic in general, which includes anything without immediate procreative purpose) instincts developed.<p>The precise nature of our sexual issues, at least the most urgent one, lies in people seeking happiness in such distorted impulses, and romanticizing, idealizing them, in the end which leads to the model of harems or nuclear families while only 3-5% of all species of mammals that are monogamous, and hardly any of them actually live in truly <q>faithful</q> couples. And all those do also feature infidelities by both partners, females included.<p>This phenomena is an immediate consequence of denatured molecules acting on the brain generating an <em>excessive attraction to all traits (inner or outer) in a partner that are innately associated with the breeding scheme</em>.<p class=important id=fat_ass>From a male perspective, this means a hard-on for symbols of fertility (big booty) or the female submissiveness to her <q>alpha</q> male.<p>It also stacks up with time, creating a paradoxal heterosexual structure we then automatically believe to be natural and not learned. We get used to these unnatural urges to fuck (for men) or breed (mostly for girls, since early childhood causing things like the fixation on dolls) <em>creating in every person</em> growing up under the influence of cooking <em>whole personality traits at odds with our instinctive programming</em>.<p>On top of that, the Oedipus complex
<a href=/#oedipus>of which we talk below</a> intervenes, building up on that accumulating exacerbated libido, cementing the fixation on maternal figures. Something similar happens with women too but less so, making for a blurrier limit between love and friendships among women. As diet only worsened in the long run (because of the lack of rationalism and formalization of the issue), culture could only stray further and further away.<p>Degenerate Amerimutts (or niggers) jacking off to the worse porn for years, while drinking beverages probably less healthy as acid battery at this point, biologically lost the cerebral sensibility for metasexuality the same way epileptics can not play the violin.<p>On the contrary, talking from experience the most striking aspect of a relationship loaded with energy, is the constant feeling of consciousness expansion. It seems like the other person is part of ourselves, as if our consciousness extended to it, and more. Obviously this impression is at its peak when we make love, for metasexuality is the evolutionary co-opting by evolution of the intense contact of mucosa and exchange of fluids occuring with sexuality, as physical vectors of energy<sup id=fnref:4><a href=#fn:4 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>4</a></sup>.<p>Everything we see looks <em>different, richer in tone, hues and shape, carrying yet unforeseen meanings we can&rsquo;t quite pinpoint or label with words</em>. As if reminding us of things we had forgotten until then. The world is transfigurated. Songs like

<a href=https://genius.com/Toto-rosanna-lyrics rel="external nofollow" target=_blank>Rosanna</a> explore that state although usually (read: <em>in the culinary referential</em>) it can only be attained sporadically, in rare spurts only frustrating even more that no technique can latch onto.<p>This state of consciousness is the hallmark of the metapsychic program, whose very purpose is the expansion of consciousness. Sex itself, is transfigurated. Sensations are much more powerful, they last longer, and keep you satisfied for the whole day (or several) on both the organic level and metapsychic or spiritual level. The mere remembrance of magical liaison can sustain us for long periods of erotic starvation, as it did with Guy‑Claude in prison.<p>It is not about reaching orgasm anymore (though it does come eventually, in all its mind-blowing glory), our mind can <em>breath</em> and focus on subtle sensations or not focusing at all, just <q>letting go</q>. My point is, there is no need to <q>think</q> anymore, things just happen on their own, <em>bodies move on their accords</em>, fantasies pop up at the right moment, with little to no words to be uttered.<p>Having multiple partners is very much appreciated, but <em>not as a way to cope with boredom</em>. We understand <em>love as an exchange of consciousness-information</em>, hence more partners can mean more knowledge, but only in the right state of mind, in the right energetic circumstances. In those circumstances <em>we learn to talk directly and receive its answers through visions</em>.<p><strong>But on the other hand:</strong><br>Because the purpose of our existence is spiritual, because we are wired for metasexuality, behaving like cows and roosters, spending our time breeding and raising kids as a means to an end like any inferior animal does (instead of an extension or a function of energy, to increase beauty or consciousness on Earth and enact destiny) actively depletes our energy level, with depression as a result. Indeed depression is not a chemical brain imbalance but the feeling of an inner lack, <em>the lack of the literal soul stuff</em>, which hurts more deeply than any food shortage, especially when no one has any clue about the causes.<p class="important aside">Roosters do not suffer from chasing females half of the day, because Nature wills it&mldr; For that reason their ridiculous prideful character doesn&rsquo;t feel off nor dysfunctional.<p>In the elated state of consciousness metasexuality aims at and induces, all notions such as age or sex are discarded, only beauty - inner <em>and</em> outer - matters, <em>and the burning need make the world a better life</em>, expressing the eternal archetypal Essences we are both drawing from and drawn to. I can assert from both theory and experience, that the biggest problem - beside cooking - which makes those relationships very difficult to maintain, is the constant inner work they require, <strong>lest energy and the mindboggling sex to gradually disappear, as resentment and enmity settle</strong>.<p>More than five consecutive decades of observations showed that a free exercise of what Freud called <q>polymorphisms</q> - anything not seen in human and apes and outside coitus constitute the perfect conditions an advanced and eerily precise form of clairvoyance, in which it sufficed to merely <em>ask</em> questions, <em>any</em> question, and see the reply in a visual sense&mldr; sometimes hear it.<br>These facts are nothing new in history: such relationships or disinhibited love in general (which does include cases of heterosexuality) were often labelled as being the source of magic, witchcraft, divine inspirations, with extreme regularity. European Middle-Age, Ancient Egypt, Greek-Roman civilization, Celts, the whole of Asia.<p>Ranging from repairing complex electronic devices by seeing the single transistor needing replacement, or divining the exact place of turtle eggs in three coordinates - longitudinal, latitudinal distance <em>plus depth</em> - in a vast sand beach, foretelling up to the decimal the exact selling figure to predict the year&rsquo;s budget in an import company, or obtaining precise on several months of someone&rsquo;s life several thousand kilometers away.<blockquote class="important aside">Theorizing occurred very spontaneously, with observations in a hitherto unknown dietary context that could be called <q>preculinary referential</q>. The radical change in eating habits and elimination of all the stimulants present in common foods: gluten (cereals), exorphins (milk), caffeine, theobromine (chocolate), alcohol, AGE etc., made possible wholly unprecedented observations under cooking’s rule. Those taking part in this unusual experience saw their sexual excitability change dramatically. It was thus possible to bring out what can be called <em>the natural laws of human sexuality</em> and to highlight unknown - or generally hidden - relationships between amorous behavior and the development of extrasensory faculties.</blockquote><cite>—Essay on metasexuality</cite><p>While extremely impressive the required conditions explain why these things are so rare today even in seemingly <q>correct</q> relationships. <em>The extrasensory requires a very calm nervous system, undisturbed by cooking-related excitants</em>, and so, maintaining dietary discipline to a T over the years, a feat few over the time have proved capable of.<br>To realize one is subject to

But male homosexuals are mostly unanimous as to what contact provides the stronger pleasure, by miles: passive sodomy.<p>In essence this issue is not limited to gays or male homos. Though bonobos do show a great deal of our erotic genetic norm, what we should aspire to and express if not for induced sexual repression (and endogenous inhibitions due to cooking), on the other hand it seems like we did improve on them, a lot.<p>We became much more atune to energy, much more capable to feel it, internalize and metabolize it: the evolution toward complexity of consciousness started with apes, continued within our own lineage, with some failures and successes along the way, in the form of the various phenotypes/species either continuously improving on themselves, mixing out, erased by others or failing to adapt to climate changes. Though we currently fill them with shit our big brains theoretically allow for an expanded consciousness richer in experience than anything a primate&rsquo;s could host.<p>The most obvious <strong>anatomical</strong> change associated with such a heightened metapsychical metabolism (beside brain size) that our theory can explain, is our much improved ability for <strong>passive</strong> sodomy.<p>People who unlocked it fully, be them men or women, can lubricate very quickly, better than most vaginas can boast of. This very fact is still ignored (or flat out rejected in a self-justification lashing-out) by <q>authorities</q> in the matter, even the most disgustingly liberal ones:<blockquote><p>Before I slide down this particular pole, let me reveal a bias: I am a firm believer that lube makes any sexual activity much more pleasurable. The wetter and slipperier everything is, the better. But lubricant is not just desirable; it&rsquo;s essential to any anal penetration. Unlike the vagina, the anus and rectum are not self-lubricating.<br>During anal exploration of yourself or a partner, you might find that the anus feels wet. What you&rsquo;re feeling is a natural mucous secretion from the anal canal and maybe some sweat—but neither this nor spit provides enough wetness to do the trick. Beyond sneaking a finger a millimeter inside someone&rsquo;s ass, <em>you need lube</em>.</blockquote><p>We find the same discourse from a rabid retarded Christian:<blockquote><p>Finally, the human sexual body itself reflects what is natural, the tradition taught. A penis can slide into a vagina easily and comfortably during love-making, while anal penetration requires artificial lubrication and often causes pain.</blockquote><p class=important id=anal_lubrication>Which is remarkably wrong on all accounts. <strong>There exists a distinct anal lubrication</strong>, which might even make adjunction of saliva unnecessary.<p>Specialized glands exist called anal glands, whose original function is to ensure adequate lubrication during excretion at the end of the tube:
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anal_gland rel="external nofollow" target=_blank>the glands of Hermann and Fossé</a><sup id=fnref:10><a href=#fn:10 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>10</a></sup>. They also produce odoriferous substances marking a male&rsquo;s territory. It also helps the natural inner cleaning of the anus and rectum.<sup id=fnref:11><a href=#fn:11 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>11</a></sup> Those same glands must have been repurposed since our separation from chimpanzees (at least some good 9 millions years ago) in order to support penile sodomy all the way. Under good psychological conditions an individual can excrete an ungodly amount of such lubricant - enough to visibly grease buttocks - with little to no stimulation, reliably.<p>The fact the majority of people (not even of homosexuals) can not boast of such a feat, is easy to account for, not contradicting the theory one bit. Vaginas lubricate better in most circumstances because of the following:<ol><li>Vagina are meant (mainly) for reproduction from the moment of the first periods, hence its lubrication is under control of the same chaotic breeding instincts amplified by dietary feedback. As there are reasons to believe in an excessive fertility on a physiological and hormonal level, women could logically lubricate too easily, when neither energy nor the need or desire to make a baby arise, as an automatic response to a situation evocative of breeding. In other words, in presence of a triggering pattern specific to the breeding instinctive program.<li>This program, being more animalistic in nature, activates much more easily that&rsquo;s why it has to be actively (though spontaneously) restrained and corralled into more civilized and transcendent goals, <strong>sublimated</strong>, as Freud would have. Hence under extreme existential frustration and confusion of programs (akin to a BIOS corruption in a computer more than a simple OS bug), mating mechanisms would logically run amok<sup id=fnref:12><a href=#fn:12 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>12</a></sup>.</ol><p id=why-sodomy-doesnt-work>On the other hand the three natural sources of lubricants necessary for a seemless sodomy totally depend on rather strict metasexual requirements, automatically ruling out it working in presence of feedback-induced endogenous stress or excitation.<p>These <em>three sources</em> are:<ul><li>Penises do produce a coat of lubricant (called Cowper&rsquo;s fluid or vulgarly precum), an excellent one, which nevertheless only answers to very important desires often of the metasexual kind such as age gap. For the same reason it can&rsquo;t be forced either, and often lack in intercourses.<li>Saliva is also an abundant source: but not just any saliva like the one involved in the early oral phase of digestion. <em>While it lacks an official recognition</em>, there is a distinct kind of fat viscous saliva excreted on command by the mouth&rsquo;s many glands (abundantly so).<li><strong>Anal lubrication proper</strong><sup id=fnref1:10><a href=#fn:10 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>10</a></sup>.<br>This biological ability, by far the most important for a pleasurable penetration, is also by far the most sensitive.

And as for walking or talking, learning how to love requires the active involvement of adults, of <strong>a functional society</strong> let a dire deficiency to take place and be extremely difficult - though not impossible - overcome afterward.<p>For someone who did not grow his sensibility in due time nor endeavoured to compensate afterward with conscious efforts, any attempt at penetration, even with fingers, will be met with <em>the anus clamping extremely strongly</em>, beside the absence of lubrification, leading most gays (let alone heterosexuals) to resort to lube.<p>This mere biological incompability (at least statistically) between sophisticated cooking and even the physical components of metasexuality, is the main reason behind the rarity of natural sodomy today, <strong>even for people who actually enjoy it</strong>.<p>One the other hand, with enough training and exposition to the correct sexual situations as well as the proper attitude, even very late (as Guy‑Claude Burger could attest) it works well.<h4 id=the-smell-argument class=headings><a href=#the-smell-argument>The smell argument</a></h4><p>The <strong><q>bad smell</q> or <q>unclean</q></strong> argument against sodomy has a bit more truth to it, but doesn&rsquo;t really stand up to close scrutiny either. Bad smells from feces do not exist in nature: wild animals&rsquo; stools do not smell at all and those of instincto babies neither. Healthy rectums are self-cleaning. Those odors come from systematically bad digestive processes, which otherwise would be as transparent as any organ in the body we are not supposed to think about nor can control consciously.<p>Elimination of denatured molecules in instincto and/or consecutively to viral episodes, also induces the expulsion of such <q>fragrant bouquets</q>: what goes in by error, goes out by design, or we wouldn&rsquo;t live nearly as long as we do&mldr; It also means different persons will stink more or less depending on their diet and overall health. Different cultures or the same at different points in time will vary for the same reasons, as per all pathological processes.<p>Nevertheless <strong><q>accidents</q> of a coprologic nature</strong> even without raw food are actually as uncommon as easy to avoid, pointing at <strong>bad smell and faeces rather acting as both a symbols</strong> for that disgust of anality and <strong>a convenient excuse, masking for our peace of mind the true unconscious irrational motives</strong>.<br>Beside, many vaginas also famously smell bad, proportionally to their owner&rsquo;s bad diet. Yet this doesn&rsquo;t discourage heterosexual men from shoving their dick in them.<p>We believe that increasingly complex cooking induced a world-wide tendency not only to reject sodomy on a conscious level, but more importantly it radically hinders or stop altogether, the natural tendency to lick infants to clean them, like do all mammals.<h4 id=harder-is-not-better class=headings><a href=#harder-is-not-better>Harder is not better</a></h4><p>The selective pressure of metasexual energy processing might possibly explain the loss of our

We don&rsquo;t understand these fast and extremely frequent changes (<em>Evidence suggests that the baculum was independently evolved 9 times and lost in 10 separate lineages</em>) as evidenced by the nonsensical opinions:<blockquote><p>A bone in the penis allows a male to mate for a long time with a female, which can be a distinct advantage in some mating strategies. The length of the baculum may be related to the duration of copulation in some species</blockquote><p>Except that&mldr; individual human copulations figure among the longest in the animal kingdom hands down. More likely usually chance genetic drift have a lot to do with this. But <em>In humans, the rigidity of the erection is provided entirely through blood pressure in the corpora cavernosa</em> and I don&rsquo;t think anyone has to complain&mldr; In any case our inborn expectations for performance would necessarily match our capabilities.<p>But on the other hand, being steel-hard is useless. On the contrary penile flexible softness adds a great deal to the variety of sensation, and adapt our sacro-sainct glorious penis to a wealth of locations and touchings, whose exquisiteness might actually exceed bonobos&rsquo;.

Others may feel more of a <q>spreading wave</q> of pleasure.<p>I surveyed 2,110 women, of all orientations, on whether they’ve had an anal orgasm or not. 28.4% of women have had at least one anal orgasm, which means they are certainly possible, but most women have not yet had one.<blockquote><p>It was an intense sensation like a clitoral orgasm but like ten times more intense. ya know like Mount Saint Helen just blew a wad. He was pounding me deep, hard, and fast and as he got more excited, I got more excited and we came at the same time.</blockquote><blockquote><p>The feeling lasted longer than clitoral/vaginal orgasms. I kept moaning even after he was out of me. It was amazing, it is more powerful than a vaginal orgasm. The anal area is so much more sensitive than the vagina it feels like. So the sensation was on many levels a very titillating experience.

generate either unconscious content or artistic and cultural productions of all kinds (up to foundational myths at the core of all societies) featuring our strongest fears in order to protect us from the risk of spiritual destruction that an unnatural sexuality carries, and let&rsquo;s be honest, carried out already (seeing the state humanity arrived in).<p>This inborn mental function called <strong>mythogenesis</strong><sup id=fnref:14><a href=#fn:14 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>14</a></sup> evolved to protect our most important assets (our spiritual, metapsychic integrity). It is on throttle since the start of cooking as evidenced by the strikingly profuse amount of the Paleolithic Venuses, figures we found scattered over all of Europe up to Asia Minor (Anatolia, current Turkey). Because this is the number one issue (save for cooking), women, vaginas and all the evils they unknowingly and for the most part, unvoluntarily unleashed on the world, are the epicenter of all myth-making activities everywhere in the <strong>world</strong>.<p class=danger>All myths and religions ought to either justify or solve&mdash;usually a bit of both&mdash;the constant metapsychic threat of <em>breeding-oriented sexuality</em>.<p>Therein lies the problem: we have nothing against vaginas nor coitus per se. In many situations, which should be the dominant forms of heterosexuality (
<a href=/en/incest/>incest</a> and
<a href=/#pedophilia>pedophilia</a>), it is beyond blame. It is just a shame, that with cooking, our hormonal wiring goes haywire and an eternal temptation settles, threatening our metapsychic integrity. With an uprising (and junk food) such as that of most civilized country, it becomes an absolutely irrepressible obsession, and the perdition of 90% of the population.<p>The content of actual fantasies most often take after mixed traits, not entirely pure nor impure, between good (the <em>meta</em>sexual) and evil (the <q>bestial</q>). If caricatural machistic (or the simpering, beta-male kind for the matter) heterosexuality exemplify true degeneracy, one could consider on the other hand that sodomizing girls acts as a natural counter-balancing drive, the polar opposite of degraded heterosexuality, thus helping in freeing up the libido invested in the breeding instinctive program.<blockquote class=aside><p>The Immaculate Conception rejects the idea of a divine child born out of copulation. Dracula feeds on the blood of his partners. For a century, the strongest of cinema has revolved around the same problem. May 68 advocated making love, not war&mldr;</blockquote><p>So we see that the model of the jealous couple was a byproduct of the breeding instinctive program, hence dominant - while not successful ! - in lower species but inoperant in higher species on their way to domesticate sexuality in service of metapsychic evolution. Many cultures, such as Catholic Europe and Ancient Greece and Rome, used to draw a strong line between marital duties in the community-sanctioned marriage (aimed respectively at maintaining the community or provide citizens/soldiers for the State), and love, sexuality, pleasure.<p>People used to <em>compartmentalize</em>, being unable to stop their depravation simply put it in a different mental and social category , to save their higher aspirations as much as possible, placing the same women they would inevitably high above them. Normally the women we fuck are kept separate, in time or persons. For instance, Italians worship their mother and daughters and would not let another man approach them, oblivious to the fact they themselves had to take away someone&rsquo;s daughter or sister<sup id=fnref:15><a href=#fn:15 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>15</a></sup>.<p>This dichotomy made of wilful ignorance and obligate splitting allows people to continue on living in society, only
<a href=/Images/meta/FIGHTclub_edit_let_go.mp4>letting go</a> of this self-imposed stabilizing pressure in specific situations, ideally wars away from home or in the worst case scenario, revolutions and civil wars with it s load of insane wholesale massacres, families reaching for each other&rsquo;s throat<sup id=fnref:16><a href=#fn:16 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>16</a></sup>. How to explain such a happening if not by the gushing out of a hitherto dormant mass of uncontrollable savage resentment, then amplified by feedback-induced madness ?<p class=important>The solution is simply for energetic relationships to dominate.<p>This constant flow of energy would then feed the occasional births, as <em>announciated in visions, prophetic dreams</em>. In nature, breeding instincts woudl simply stay under control of the metasexual/metapsychic program, and we wouldn&rsquo;t breed more than a few times per life (to maintain sane population levels) without a need for intellectual birth control. So clearly this notion can not be used to indulge in regular mock breeding, with the pretext that <q>as long as I am gay enough I am beyond reproach</q>.<p>For a woman without health issue who puts her mind to it, getting pregnant is too easy. So even if one truly had to make as much babies as humanly possible, which all Nordic people should&mdash;by law&ndash;the days justifyingly dedicated to intercourses wouldn&rsquo;t exceed a few per month.<p>Moreover, it is all the more necessary to stay pure energetically if one is called to procreate: This is the correct interpretation of the Immaculate Conception myth: breeding is a natural function, a very important one at that, and shouldn&rsquo;t contradict higher aspirations, one reason being the later (the metapsychic plane of love) having evolved much later, from the framework of reproductional sexuality, hence can only take into account. As a matter of fact Isis was goddess of <em>magic, virginity, sexuality and motherhood</em>.<p>Incidentally Isis was married to her <strong>brother</strong>, reputed to bring about agriculture of <em>cereals</em> and was cut in many pieces by his brother Seth, the personification of a <em>chaotic yet spiritually sterile sexuality</em>. An allusion to
<a href=/#splitting>schizoid dissociative tendencies</a>, whose association with cereals (wheat in particular) is
<a href=/#cereals>well-known</a>. Their association to a disturbed sexuality however, is less known,
<a href=/en/instincto/#sex>except by us</a>. In contrast, Isis and her twin Nephtys, both loved Osiris their brother so much that they magically pieced together his whole and resurrects him as well as magically give birth to a child. This created the <em>After-life, an eternal existence beyond life and death for everyone</em>.<p>Lastly, the experience in Montramé established points toward the existence, in a raw context, of a reliable <em>natural anticonceptional mechanism</em> innate to females&rsquo; body, under nervous or/and hormonal control of the unconscious, an ability known by science for many species but not until now in humans. Even in near total absence of consideration for pregnancies and protection or pills <em>unexpected pregnancy were notably sparse if existing at all</em>, unlike the avalanche one could expect despite the <em>absurd amount of chaotic fucking</em> taking place.<p>A slighty impure unconscious (or very conscious) attitude from either partner will infect the girl unconsciously, initiating a pregnancy: sadly an almost automatic occurence in society given the
<a href=/en/homonazi/#female_breeding_weakness>biological innate susceptibility of women to the instinctive reproductive complex</a>.<h4 id=the-root-of-jealousy class=headings><a href=#the-root-of-jealousy>The root of jealousy</a></h4><p>Both <q>science</q> and common wisdom concur that <em>monogamy</em> is the natural form of matings with the justification that fidelity and repetition solidify the home, create a stable environment for the offspring and take advantage of the largest window of fertility before one or the other partner has his or her menopause or the equivalent to make as many children as possible. Love is basically nature luring you with the pleasure of sex, to trick you in the hassle and <em>enormous</em> personal investment of procreation.<p>But that concept is widely contradicted by the animal world: closing the horizon of partners is illogical and lo and behold, in the majority of monogamous species, <em>adultery is the norm</em>. Settling on one partner precludes seeking the best genes in the interest of the offspring. While most inferior species, concerned only with basic reproduction, do not form lasting bonds between genitors beyond the short time it takes for younglings to reach maturity.<p>In many primitive cultures the notion of faithful couples and sexual exclusivity do not exist. Their social norms (and good diet, at least in some aspects) manage to reduce jealousy, to the point that in some cases young girls are taught to <em>ride a high number of partners</em> (according to Malinowksi, <q>bathing in semen</q>). Exclusivity is the deat of passion, love and desire. History is full of men mistreating unfaithful women horribly while they gave themselves the right to fuck any random hoe. To the extreme, men&rsquo; over-reaction is
<a href=https://www.quora.com/What-facts-could-destroy-our-romantic-notions-regarding-indigenous-people rel="external nofollow" target=_blank>beyond unimaginable in cruelty, including from the falsely called <q>Natives</q></a>.<p>There are two major causes for jealousy. At puberty heterosexuality becomes definitive for 90% of the population and takes on its <q>procreative</q> orientation&mldr; because a non-procreative heterosexuality is totally possible, as we will see. The metasexual program does not include this kind of strict sexual polarity: in particular the representation of coitus only kicks in at puberty. A sexuality centered on energy would be as if blind to gender and age differences. Simply put, orgasms and <strong>butts</strong> have no gender.<p>In nature, the infant would bath in energy from both the father and the mother, or at least people of both sex their parents or not. Instead the baby is frustrated from day one, and whenever his mind matured enough to separate himself from his mother, he also begets the category of <q>the Other</q>, the archetypal <q>third person</q>.<p>But a hypothetical situation where the father would willingly leave the child alone to sleep with the mother there wouldn&rsquo;t be much of a solution either: it&rsquo;s more complicated. An absentee father is better than a castrating or violent one, but in the end but does not provide <strong>energy</strong> either.<p>And since touching children - even our own - in any way that could provide them some erotic gratification has been progressively outlawed and vilified to the extreme, the possibility for them to feel what they should or do in nature, has become utterly impossible.<p>Due to this lack of real love, the unbelievable trauma of a sexless childhood leave every single person a permanent scare, whether we want it or not, just like malnutrition causes permanent growth issues that never fully heal afterwards.<p class=danger>Most of us become soulless golems, easy to manipulate and order around by an equally soulless but more malignant elite.<p>Freud had at first ascribed the castration complex (feeling of inferiority and groundless anxiety linked to sex) under the (admittedly detestable) practice of threatening boys with <em>cutting their dick off</em> to make them obey. Then realized the complex (sex-related feeling of anxiety or guilt) was just as present when parents did not employ these methods.<p>Typically, as the mother is too absorbed in her suffering within her marital relationship, she has nothing to give and quickly enough the baby resents the father as the responsible, often rightfully so. Freud described the jealousy of fathers toward their infant children, monopolizing the mother and so hindering men&rsquo; access to sex.

It is essential for animals to learn to delay the satisfaction or expression of instincts until the context is right, depending on the environment, physical or social. All animals can do it to some degree, while obviously the bigger the brain the higher the capacity for <em>metacognition and rationalization</em> and thus, for investing that resources, psychic or physical, toward not the specific outcome desired, but the proximate steps toward a later but ultimately more desirable fulfillment of some kind for that instinct. We do not blindly give in to impulses and the urge for immediate gratification, to favor a better future as our intellect predicts. <em>No more <q>muh diik nigga</q></em>.<p>This natural attribute becomes neurosis and pathological, when the <em>unconsciously internalized</em> result of a <em>repressive parental upbringing</em> (or similar conditionings) <em>takes the place of <em>conscious</em> rational motives</em>, <em>deviating or perverting that drive</em> toward socially desirable outcomes leaving said desires unfulfilled and the individual unknowingly frustrated.<p>But since typically sexual desires are all aimed at energy and metapsychic ends, they are not offset easily and frustration pents up, ordering all that nervous energy to go somewhere, twisting the personality in increasingly worse ways as years go by. Broadly speaking, unconscious neurosis (almost a tautology) is to current people&rsquo;s mind, what the conscious rational and <em>conditional</em> postponing of behaviors waiting for a favorable context, was to the natural mind. <strong>Feedback</strong> doesn&rsquo;t play a big role here, but crank up the next component (paranoia) up to eleven, which then amplifies the frustration and compulsions resulting from neurosis.<h3 id=paranoia class=headings><a href=#paranoia>Paranoia</a></h3><p>Paranoia, is the tendency to <q>believe in oneself</q>, regardless of evidence, experiences and rational conclusions. It is also the <q><em>ego</em></q> of Eastern philosophies while the psychoanalytic notion of <q>Ich</q>, <q>Moi</q> or <q>I</q> (often translated in the Latin <q>Ego</q>) rather equals the <q>Self</q>, the neutral sense of identity.<br>This understanding of paranoia is specific to Burger&rsquo;s metapsychoanalysis, and reflects the long experience of comparing - often in the same person - the natural state and one under <strong>feedback</strong>. Paranoia is the belief in one&rsquo;s self-righteousness and refusal to <em>acknowledge sensory reality</em>.<p>Per se, it is not <q>unnatural</q>, but positively needed as in any context we never possess the full information needed to reach logical <em>certainty</em> for anything. For any question and endeavor, an amount of choice and belief or convincing is present. The very nature of the material world, makes some level of ego indispensable, even animals need to try at things (hunting preys, courting mates, challenging males) with a modicum of hope that it might succeed, especially when the risks involved or resources invested are significant. A <q>purely logical</q> assessment or choice which would always be correct, would require total information, which is never available. And this assumes the universe <em>is</em> deterministic, but quantum physics hints at <em>probabilistic</em> universe, with unlikely occurrences of disproportionate effects (<q>Black Swans</q>) never ruled out. But when and where they happen, is inherently imprevisible through measurement.<p>The existence of <em>extra</em>-sensory perception does not allow for an categorically deterministic universe either, as spiritual informations always carry emotions and symbols, in our experience they rather broaden the range of possible outcomes, not limit them to <q>the one written to happen</q>.In fact, once can argue the extrasensory should fuel to the ego: a healthy <em>ego should derive its self-confidence from divine inspiration</em>, not from whatever inflated sense of prideful infallibility.<p><em>Trust in destiny against all odds</em> should be to a healthy spirit what ego, what paranoia or <em>narcissism</em> (all the same) are to most.<p>Ego can be labeled as pathological whenever it outgrows any useful purpose despite clear evidence that our initial bet or stance fails to deliver and we should rather change our mind. Just like men cannot imagine their penis is not the end-all-be-all, sole purveyor of bliss for the woman.<p>It is more or less with the term <q>psychosis</q>, traditionally explained as the projection of one&rsquo;s inner content or desire into reality. Still traditionally, one CAN be made aware of a neurosis and the internal complex leading to a dysfunctional behavior, <em>while a psychotic can not</em>, as the inner source of his disorder is not accessible to his conscious.<br>To be precise, one could convince intellectually a psychotic that one&rsquo;s explanation is logical and <em>the cause does not lie outside</em> - someone being a reincarnation of Napoleon the First) but <em>inside</em> - the belief and desire of being Napoleon. But the psychotic will <em>still</em> have the very same impression, perceiving this reality as surely as he perceives his own mind.<br>It is said that curing psychosis is not possible, but we observed differently: paranoia tends to dwindle and we becomes able to see the world how it really appears (and maybe make a <em>conscious choice</em> to do otherwise, a healthy bet on an hypothetical but not impossible outcome). We become capable to see certitudes not as unconditional exterior facts, but simply as <em>beliefs</em>, inner content we give more or less credit.<p>We ascribe the egotic structuring of the self - primary narcissism and all paranoid, obsessive tendencies - to the early exposition of cooked food:<blockquote>The alimentary origin of a primary paranoia, attributable to a defective learning of the alliesthetic variations of the gustatory pleasure in the culinary context and hypothecating the oedipal period through the overinvestment of the precocious impulses.</blockquote><p>The idea is simple: raw food constantly changes from time to time, from terrible or downright painful, to bland or heavenly. Strawberries do not taste like strawberries, we discover a whole range of interesting variations, a true tapestry or symphony of tastes. Learning this reality very early (as a baby) when we barely start dissociating oneself from the outside world, has the effect of cementing an open minded attitude which sees expectations or hopes as anything but certain, while simply heeding one&rsquo;s senses of tastes and smell registers as the surest way to get pleasure, bliss, happiness. We learn to trust reality and mold our desires onto it, not to expect it to match our desires and <em>lashing out when they inevitably don&rsquo;t</em>.<p>On the other hand <em>starting life with cooked food, whose taste is linear</em> and always the same for a given food, does not lend itself to open mindedness, rather the opposite, to a assumption of <em>control</em>: <em>we learn that things are what we expect them to be</em>, and our happiness or sense of identity relies on our ability to predict them. We develop an obsession with <em>knowing</em> and controlling outcomes, and enter a state of wilful <em>denial</em> when it fails, refusing to accept facts.<p>This was for cooking&rsquo;s role in the early psychic structure. But it also amps up the innate brain tendency to confuse one&rsquo;s intellectual (or emotional) projections with reality itself, giving them an undue level of certitude and potency:<br>This ties to the very definition of the <dfn>feedback phenomena</dfn>
, which sees the brain feeding of its own output in a retroactive feedback look, and said projections getting way out of hand, out of sync with sensory (or extrasensory) inputs.<p>In practice, this makes <q>regular</q> people eating traditional obnoxious and cocky, exceedingly difficult to tell apart delusions and extricate emotional attachment <q>from facts</q>. Up to a certain point, one can still exert metacognition to see the truth but past it, we enter the psychiatric area. This point, still, varies from case to case and person to person, each society labeling <q>crazy</q> a different spectrum of personalities. Conversely, different kinds of crazy obsessions are deemed <q>normal</q> (meaning, not perceived at all !), part of <q>consensus reality</q>.<p>Neurosis and paranoia do not contradict or exclude each other, as we said, they all stem from essential mind properties. So in any given case, both are bound to figure in some shape or form, to varying degrees, according to what model seems most fitting, how strongly invested the delusion is and how much capacity for metacognition the person keeps.<h3 id=schizoid-tendencies class=headings><a href=#schizoid-tendencies>Schizoid tendencies</a></h3><p id=splitting>The third parameter is perhaps the most difficult to understand, unless one has had personal experience with it, as it is the least accessible to consciousness, actually touching the very consciousness itself in its physical/cerebral aspect, not its content.<p>Splitting is a term used in psychiatry to describe the inability to hold or consider equally contradictory feelings or beliefs. It is the mind&rsquo;s tendency to lose unity and fragment: to forget or not keep track of what it does or thought, a phenomenon which ends up in the classic case of <q>multiple personalities</q>. However usually schizoid tendencies don&rsquo;t go nearly that far, more broadly it carries the meaning of bearing contradictory thoughts or reasonings at the same time, without being aware or making sense of it, as if separate minds were vying for attention beyond our control, causing an increasing state of <dfn tooltip="State of persistent fear or anxiety, devoid of identifiable object or motive, be it physical emotional or mental, and thus, inaccessible to analysis."><strong>groundless anxiety</strong></dfn>
often causing a spiral of further fragmentation or compartimentalization as a defense mechanism, relegating the painful feelings to the background, or to separate persona in order to alleviate consciousness in other moments.<p id=wheat>It has been proved to associate time and time again, with cereals, gluten in particular, hence with <em>wheat</em> in particular:<blockquote cite=www.doi.org/10.1126/science.1246624>The likelihood that wheat gluten is a true pathogenic factor is further suggested by reports on the psychiatric characteristics of celiac patients who are known to be intolerant to wheat gluten and its analogs (15).

As psychiatric terms, in some way paranoia and schizophrenia are polar opposite of each other, as while the first can be summarized as the incapacity to withdraw a decision or from taking any, the second is the incapacity to deal with decisions on a cognitive level.<p>Refraining from choosing immediately the most logical (as a man would) or emotionally pleasant (as women tend to do) decisions and ignoring the others is necessary evolutionary feature: all animals need the flexibility to cope with an unpredictable <em>natural</em> world. For the same reason we also need the laser-like focused intelligence of paranoia, we need the mirror-like intelligence to represent things as they are without altering or <q>improving</q> on the bare result of our perception, while keeping an underlying sense of Self of identity. We need the capacity to withdraw from further action without giving in to the compulsion to reject or act on drives based on clearly limited knowledge, or demonstrably irrational or too fleeting emotions.<p>Proper dissociation happens when we stop perceiving mental contents that don&rsquo;t mesh together, and as time goes more or more that content loses connection with itself and the rest, until the perception of both the Self and reality crumble and we can&rsquo;t make sense of anything anymore.<p>To simplify things, in order to get back some stability, the reaction to an undesirable pulsion can be neurosis (burying the original unadulterated fantasies under the weight of more palatable, fake ones), psychosis or paranoia (easing tension by projecting ideas on the outside world or sometimes identifying to it) and lastly dissociation, by eliminating it completely.<p>Though the book does elaborate on likely psychological causes fuelling dissociation or <em><em>cleavage</em></em>, it is a cognitive problem directly induced by denatured molecules disturbing the brain&rsquo;s functions and natural harmony, destabilizing the mind. With years and traumatic experiences (which as we will see, have proven to be the norm in a Western upbringing, not the exception) this creates a schizoid mode of functioning, in which troublesome contents are stopped from making spreading discontent and unease by disappearing from sight and the effort required to make sense of an outside world difficult to understand and rather hostile, <em>gradually discarded</em>.<p>As such, while neurosis can be induced in animals with high enough stress, the levels of dissociation we see in society do not seem possible to induce in someone who grew up under raw food.<p>The drive or desire (having wild barebone doggy-style sex with your mother!) still exists, its energy is not disinvested, removed from the mind, but we loose track of it, a part of the mind itself becomes out of reach, left to rot and fragment further. The stronger the forclosed complexe/instinct, the more and faster the mind unravels, hence the most dire cases of schizophrenia often relate to childhood conflicts linked to love and guilt, carrying an existential weight unlike any other.<h3 id=pedophilia class=headings><a href=#pedophilia>Pedophilia</a></h3><h4 id=what-to-take-away class=headings><a href=#what-to-take-away>What to take away</a></h4><p>In the strictest sense of the word, we claim th elabel of <em>pedophiles</em>.

Nazi pedophiles, what more to ask ?<p class=important>On a psychologicla level, infantilizing children is the very cause for their current immaturity. History proves that they can become self-reliable before 10 and understand the implications of life and death, and we believe that <strong>who can kill, can fuck</strong>.<h4 id=peer-pressure-and-society-induced-trauma class=headings><a href=#peer-pressure-and-society-induced-trauma>Peer pressure and society-induced trauma</a></h4><p class=important><strong>Yet, we oppose sudden changes of laws.</strong><ol><li>As a child grows up in a highly repressive environment or cultural norms and talks about his experience, she will be labeled as a pervert and forced to denounce her lover, or suffer consequences, from legal punishment to social isolation or outright murder.<li>People abhor the idea of having sex with children because they <strong>themselves</strong> live love on an utterly uninspired material or <q>carnal</q> level missing the purpose of their existence, and by default project their own wretchedness on all relationships. Although we must stress, the number of actually violent pedophilic rapes are an extreme minority.</ol><p>Chances are the kid <strong>will</strong> cave in to social pressure and gradually convince herself that she has been abused. A child cannot be expected to take on the whole of society and his parents <em>as most adults cannot either</em>. They will distort their memories to fit with social narratives, and this memory revision can occur immediately or years after, puberty when the adolescent enters sexuality on the same degraded level, that of repetitive coitus, which is easily symbolizd and conflated with rape. But even if everything is done perfectly with the best of intentions, which is almost unconceivable today with this food and the lack of initiation in early childhood, in most cases the victim under the influence of the dominant morality might interpret the relationship as rape, <strong>afterwards</strong>. So, we are absolutely pro-contact&mldr; <strong>in theory, not in practice</strong>.<h2 id=conclusion class=headings><a href=#conclusion>Conclusion</a></h2><p>Our very survival depends on restoring the metapsychic instinctive complexity. There has been many movements in the past that exalted racial chauvinism with nothing to show for it, their goal was to found a White ethno-state completely detached from the social practices that made our people great in the first place, their relentless reactionary dogmas and purity spiraling only lead to hate, frustration, destruction and despair, and the suppression of individuals within their own groups that recognized these blatant contradictions.<p>Many will still retort that the White race is dwindling and reducing the number of breeders endangers it, as Himmler claimed. This argument makes no sense as even given an interrupted chain of pregnancies, the amount of intercourses required for impregnation is very small. On the contrary, the elimination of labor pains after a year of strict instinctive diet&mdash;and the life-changing calm of babies and children&mdash;will make pregnancies and parenthood much more attractive.<p>However we differ from those people because we are not bound by any contrarian desire nor neurotic compulsion which manipulates our judgment, rendering us insensitive or spiteful towards the very forms of love that allowed true high cultures to blossom. Eros, which includes sexuality, is the greatest motivator for in-group preferences within your racial family <em>as satisfied people know nothing will ever satiate their desire better than their own ethnos</em>.<br>A good racist encourages anything creating stronger bonds between blood brethren.<p>The logical outcome of love is sex and no honest person can claim to love his own people while endorsing socially repressive policies facilitating its destruction.<p>The need for repression would imply the innate corruption of nature, a hallmark of Judaism, the undying mortal enemy of Nordic humanity, and life on Earth as a whole. Instead, our solution is to embrace incest, pedophilia, homosexuality and shun coitus outside the two aforementioned situations. Then everything can be fine. There is no need to repress anything, just reeducate ourself, and get rid of unnatural impulses that should never develop in the first place.<figure><figcaption>The purest love</figcaption><a role=presentation target=_blank href=/Images/nazi_holocaust_weimar_ww2/photo_hitler_jeune_fille_juive2.webp><img src=/Images/nazi_holocaust_weimar_ww2/photo_hitler_jeune_fille_juive2_hu65e87d0446db7dbcf6160c1578521c7e_320126_800x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp srcset="/Images/nazi_holocaust_weimar_ww2/photo_hitler_jeune_fille_juive2_hu65e87d0446db7dbcf6160c1578521c7e_320126_800x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 800w, /Images/nazi_holocaust_weimar_ww2/photo_hitler_jeune_fille_juive2_hu65e87d0446db7dbcf6160c1578521c7e_320126_604x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 604w, /Images/nazi_holocaust_weimar_ww2/photo_hitler_jeune_fille_juive2_hu65e87d0446db7dbcf6160c1578521c7e_320126_400x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 400w, /Images/nazi_holocaust_weimar_ww2/photo_hitler_jeune_fille_juive2_hu65e87d0446db7dbcf6160c1578521c7e_320126_200x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 200w" loading=lazy alt="Picture of Hitler with a young girl" title="The purest love" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, (max-width: 600px) 50vw, 400px" width=800px height=582px style=--height-limit:582px></a></figure><p>Love is the binding force of the universe, it carries the spiritual currents of inspiration driving us forward, it brings out our full potential by exceeding the limitation of matter, connecting forlorn glorious past and limitless future.

Chimpanzees are one of the most well-studied primates, due to our biases toward studying our closest relatives. Bonobos are equally related to us, but chimpanzees are better studied due to their wider geographic distribution, and higher numbers in captivity. The longest-running chimpanzee field sites have been running for over 50 years. The answer is that we have not missed it entirely, but simply overlooked it as part of a suite of other behaviors. It has been documented by many studies before, but often is reported as something other than “sociosexual behavior,” subsumed under behaviors such as “reassurance” or “reconciliation,” or “gestures”. This likely is related to cultural biases preventing consideration of these behaviors as related to sexuality, particularly the potential for homosexuality. Sandel and Reddy point out that Jane Goodall, as well as other primatologists, have observed such behaviors in chimpanzees.</blockquote>&#160;<a href=#fnref:5 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a><li id=fn:6><blockquote><p>Never, however, have we seen anything that could be regarded as homosexuality in chimpanzees… Admittedly, a male may mount another in times of stress or excitement, clasping the other around the waist, and he may even make thrusting movements of the pelvis, but there is no intromission. It is true, also, that a male may try to calm himself or another male by reaching out to touch or pat the other’s genitals; while we still have much to learn about this type of behavior, it certainly does not imply homosexuality. He only does this in moments of stress, and he will touch or pat a female on her genitals in exactly the same context.</blockquote>&#160;<a href=#fnref:6 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a><li id=fn:7><blockquote><p>When those behaviors in bonobos are classified as “sociosexual” whereas in chimpanzees they are classified as ‘’reassurance,” it prevents us from directly comparing and contrasting behaviors between the two sister species. Furthermore, it prevents us from considering ape sexuality, and the potential for homosexual apes, on its own terms.</blockquote>&#160;<a href=#fnref:7 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a><li id=fn:8><blockquote><p>There are also cultural factors that may hinder studying and reporting sociosexual behaviors. Ngogo is located in Uganda, where there has been a series of controversial laws that criminalized homosexuality, <em>with penalties for “promoting” or “failing to report” homosexuality</em>. There are several other countries with similar laws where chimpanzee field sites are located. This can potentially affect research in two ways: first, queer primatologists may not feel safe conducting fieldwork there. Second, researchers and field assistants might be more hesitant to characterize same-sex behaviors in a way that could imply homosexuality because of cultural and legal risks.

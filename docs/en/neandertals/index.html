We unraveled the real origin of the human species, the origin of races and the role of cooking in causing our devolution from a perfected ancestral state, with stronger senses, brain and bodies and a lifespan ten times longer. Europeans - White people in general, Nordics in particular - descend almost only from Neanderthals.<h2 id=uncovering-our-ancestors class=headings><a href=#uncovering-our-ancestors>Uncovering our ancestors</a></h2><h3 id=logical-fallacies-of-the-out-of-africa-theory class=headings><a href=#logical-fallacies-of-the-out-of-africa-theory>Logical fallacies of the Out-of-Africa theory</a></h3><p>Biology and evolution theory textbooks, documentaries, all science, it seems, teach that the <em>modern</em> human species, the current one, descends from African apes about 6 million years ago (the number varies) from which a great number of other groups proliferated, developed and died, or merged with our remote ancestors, until they emerged victorious in the great evolutionary contest.<p>For the first part, we see nothing to criticize. When and where exactly we separated from bonobos, how long we wandered in Africa, is but of a mild intellectual interest at best as at the end of the day we were still <strong>apes</strong>, not human by any stretch of the word. Nothing political here. It gets hairy when we touch upon the emergence of men with brain size at least relative to ours, from 1200 cc onward.<p>But then the establishment argues that modern man left Africa around 50,000 B.C. to conquer all of Asia and Europe, mostly replacing and driving to extinction the species of men (called primitive> or archaic) already present. To then become fully modern, but strangely enough <strong>only outside Africa</strong>: Africans have stayed nearly identical for more than 100 000 years.<p>We have to visualize meak

Even the Inuit, despite a raw diet very rich in vitamins and a skin less dark than that of the Blacks, traditionally suffer from deficiencies and have a short life.<li>Not only would they would have to survive, but also beat the natives intrinsically adapted to a low-light environment with revolutionary features such as fair hair and blue eyes, and a robust body frame (Modern Europeans hold almost all strongman positions and strength records in the world).</ul><a role=presentation target=_blank href=/Images/memes/we_wuz_kangz_n_shieet.webp><img src=/Images/memes/we_wuz_kangz_n_shieet.webp srcset="/Images/memes/we_wuz_kangz_n_shieet.webp 640w, /Images/memes/we_wuz_kangz_n_shieet_hu389193be7f46fd611776e83a66d079d7_606494_604x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 604w, /Images/memes/we_wuz_kangz_n_shieet_hu389193be7f46fd611776e83a66d079d7_606494_400x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 400w, /Images/memes/we_wuz_kangz_n_shieet_hu389193be7f46fd611776e83a66d079d7_606494_200x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 200w" loading=lazy alt="Kangz meme" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, (max-width: 600px) 50vw, 400px" width=640px height=960px style=--height-limit:960px></a><p>But somehow after an epic race war against these Übermensch, Blacks fell into an eternal slumber of the mind from which they haven&rsquo;t woken up.

And because no non-European blue-eyed populations existed outside Europe. Moving the goal post is the primary strategy, in genetic research, constantly postponing the need to prove the Out-Of-Africa narrative. Systematically the goal post is shifted to earlier and earlier times, which is incredibly convenient, <em>as DNA recovered for that time is irreparably damaged, thus unusable</em>. It is argued now that blue are about 50,000 years old, and that Neanderthals had a mutation on OCA2 (the gene responsible), yes, but not the same. Because no non-European blue-eyed populations existed outside Europe.<p>Because, there were none, because all European &ldquo;Sapiens&rdquo; <strong>are</strong> Neanderthals, which incidentally <strong>are</strong> described as blue or green-eyed. The molecular clock method is absolutely inadmissible for such a timespan because DNA so old is nowhere near intact enough or exploitable enough, so proving or disproving their claims this time will stay forever impossible. And <em>assertions that can not be proved nor could be disproved are not scientific</em>, and thus pointless.<h3 id=the-mitochondrial-eve class=headings><a href=#the-mitochondrial-eve>The mitochondrial Eve</a></h3><p>The two most salient points argued by proponents of the Out-of-Africa viewpoint, are that:<ul><li>Populations in Africa has more diversity overall than all populations out of Africa, in some cases featuring more unique haplotypes than the rest of the world combined<li>According to

These computations are obtained by running simple algorithms and formulas on respectively the whole of the mitochondrial DNA (16.5kb) for the female line and a digested Y chromosome for the male line, because these two genetic elements are inherited strictly through the parent of their respective sex with no contribution from the other parent.<p>What allowed this turning back of the clock, is the <strong>molecular clock</strong>, the first of the several wrong assumptions the mitochondrial Eve (or <abbr tooltip="Most Recent Common Ancestor" role=term>MRCA</abbr>) make. The idea, is that sequences not subject to a selection would diverge neither faster (as under positive selection) nor slower (as under negative or purifying selection, eliminating all deviation from a strict norm) than what the slow, random accumulation of chance mutations would entail, according the average mutational rate. This only concerns non-coding sequences, <em>supposed</em> to have no effect, thus free to accumulate change.<p>But this reasoning is erroneous for many reasons. The concept of a molecular clock, in particular for long-lived and ubiquitous (living everywhere) species like ours so much variability in lifestyle, climate of election and mating practices, has no power to go back in time more than a few tens of millenia.

In all likelihood multiple branches of Erectus around the world, including the Eurasian ones, evolved along a common trend of cerebral increase (at different rates though) with very slow but continuous by gene exchanges along genetic <dfn tooltip="Measurable gradient in a single character (or biological trait) of a species across its geographical range.

?<p>The oldest Homo Ergaster would be the ancestor of homo erectus in Asia. It is likely that it is also the ancestor of in Europe. It may seem hard to believe populations of twice 800,000 years divergence can still interbred (Pygmies and Norwegians to take the purest examples), but in reality it is not the only case in nature. Time is less important than the mutation rate, and amount of selected, significant mutations vs neutral ones vs drift, and some adaptations matter more than others when it comes to breeding, resulting in various degrees of anatomical, genetic, behavior incompatibilities etc. All of this, one cannot estimate from time passing only.<p>The likes of the Tautavel Man (Europe, 455 000 years) with very mature features somewhat closer to Erectus with 1166 cm³, is hard to place. We don&rsquo;t really need to think that far, as various theories based on analyzes are routinely invalidated: paleontology competes with social psychology for the medal of the softest science. However a large consensus is established regards to Tautavel as the first safe element of the line of Neandertals.<p>So it seems likely, to conclude, that at least 500 000 years ago, due to environmental changes (the onset of the last, still ongoing glacial cycle) started differentiating with a common trend towards an increase in brain size - as getting dumber is never an advantage.<br>Notice how the modern European skull meant to have appeared all around the world at the same time around -40 000 has nothing in common with neither modern nor Ancient African skulls, whereas the Asiatic and European skulls look a lot like a <em>juvenile</em> Neandertals skull (which does not show yet prominent brow-ridges).<p class=center>archaic homo sapiens:<ul class=center><li><a role=presentation target=_blank href=/Images/biology/cranes_africains_ancestrales/qafzeh_9_skull_from_israel.webp><img src=/Images/biology/cranes_africains_ancestrales/qafzeh_9_skull_from_israel.webp srcset="/Images/biology/cranes_africains_ancestrales/qafzeh_9_skull_from_israel.webp 436w, /Images/biology/cranes_africains_ancestrales/qafzeh_9_skull_from_israel_hubc22383290776d788fa08000498cd76e_81848_400x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 400w, /Images/biology/cranes_africains_ancestrales/qafzeh_9_skull_from_israel_hubc22383290776d788fa08000498cd76e_81848_200x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 200w" loading=lazy alt=qafzeh_9_skull_from_israel sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, (max-width: 600px) 50vw, 400px" width=436px height=383px style=--height-limit:383px></a><li><a role=presentation target=_blank href=/Images/biology/cranes_africains_ancestrales/skhul_5.webp><img src=/Images/biology/cranes_africains_ancestrales/skhul_5.webp srcset="/Images/biology/cranes_africains_ancestrales/skhul_5.webp 501w, /Images/biology/cranes_africains_ancestrales/skhul_5_hub2dcba697e6b4361264f087779677855_97322_400x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 400w, /Images/biology/cranes_africains_ancestrales/skhul_5_hub2dcba697e6b4361264f087779677855_97322_200x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 200w" loading=lazy alt=skhul_V sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, (max-width: 600px) 50vw, 400px" width=501px height=437px style=--height-limit:437px></a></ul><p class=center>The <q>modern</q> African:<ul class=center><li><a role=presentation target=_blank href=/Images/biology/cranes_africains_ancestrales/africain_moderne_1.webp><img src=/Images/biology/cranes_africains_ancestrales/africain_moderne_1.webp srcset="/Images/biology/cranes_africains_ancestrales/africain_moderne_1.webp 433w, /Images/biology/cranes_africains_ancestrales/africain_moderne_1_hu52b1f49d039296d351a2488cba37b085_85954_400x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 400w, /Images/biology/cranes_africains_ancestrales/africain_moderne_1_hu52b1f49d039296d351a2488cba37b085_85954_200x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 200w" loading=lazy alt="africain-1.webp (655×443)" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, (max-width: 600px) 50vw, 400px" width=433px height=368px style=--height-limit:368px></a><li><a role=presentation target=_blank href=/Images/biology/cranes_africains_ancestrales/africain_moderne_2.webp><img src=/Images/biology/cranes_africains_ancestrales/africain_moderne_2.webp srcset="/Images/biology/cranes_africains_ancestrales/africain_moderne_2.webp 461w, /Images/biology/cranes_africains_ancestrales/africain_moderne_2_hub0209c786b9e1cef2a485eaf284005ee_65096_400x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 400w, /Images/biology/cranes_africains_ancestrales/africain_moderne_2_hub0209c786b9e1cef2a485eaf284005ee_65096_200x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 200w" loading=lazy alt="af.webp (461×365)" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, (max-width: 600px) 50vw, 400px" width=461px height=365px style=--height-limit:365px></a></ul><p>The Nordic European skull currently peak at 1500 and average at 1440 cm³.

That meant their intelligence was from significantly higher than ours to genius-level on a species-scale, maxing out everything they could get from their organ.<p>An alternative hypothesis states that because eye sizes have been shown to be adaptations to cold (to the preponderance of snow in the Arctic environment, to be precise), and brain size positively correlate to eye sizes, thus the bigger eye sockets (not biggers <em>eyes</em> mind you) of Neanderthals would explain their bigger brains without implying a higher intelligence.<p>But this demonstrably <strong>wrong</strong>.<br>This correlation means nothing. Logically, at most we should assume propotionality, meaning that twice the visual information should require at most twice the processing power, hence at most twice the brain volume in the visual cortex, the part dedicated to visual information processing.<br>And we see quickly that this correlation is not proportional at all:<blockquote><p>The results showed that the biggest brains, averaging 1,484 millilitres, were from Scandinavia, while the smallest brains, around 1,200 millilitres, came from Micronesia. Average eye socket size was 27 millilitres in Scandinavia and 22 millilitres in Micronesia.</blockquote><p>The conclusion would be that Nordic Europeans got 300 additional cc of brain to process a mere 23% increase in visual information, while the visual cortex is but

Scandinavian eye size being just 23% bigger than Micronesians&rsquo;, if we suppose proportionality, this difference should only explain 56 more cubic centimeters, not <em>5 times more</em>.<p>Samewise, another argument relates to body size. Among related species differences in brain size have been correlated to difference in body mass: the more mass, the more information to process. Leading to the false assumption that relative (to the body) brain size matters more for intelligence than absolute size, although

All <strong>recessive traits</strong> that should very much betray any significant admixture, but they don&rsquo;t.<p>Then the most salient weakness of that idea, is that if mixing had been the cause, the first intermediate forms should show considerably more admixture than later forms and not less, then as the hybrids back-cross into the wider Neanderthal population (as necessary to reduce the admixture to less than one percent as she claims), forms should normalize in aspect, and be closer to the Neanderthal type. The reason is simple: mixing is not a continuous, but a step-wise process, with the first generation necessarily starting at 50% (metis on steroids), then half that, then half that, etc.<br>But as we saw, the <strong>opposite</strong> is true: we see in some sites a very continuous morphological weakening in bones&rsquo; robustness, skull size etc, instead of a drastic shift to a gracile type.

As a result the genetic or epigenetic patrimony is ever more damaged, incurring a gradual loss of highly evolved traits less and less required or even incompatible with life in civilization, such as a superior intelligence or anti-social tendencies.<p>Mental automatisms known as feedback that automatically accompany cooking cause an imbalance of higher mind functions and the essential divide with the extrasensory world. This is the real reason behind the tendency for civilization which took root since. Christians would call this the Fall:<blockquote>And to Adam He said:<br><q>Because you have listened to the voice of your wife and have eaten from the tree of which I commanded you not to eat, cursed is the ground because of you; through toil you will eat of it all the days of your life.

This indicates that have a super strong god-like body was never really necessary for Neandertals to survive in nature&mldr; nor were psychic powers either. The only explanation for our evolution is Lamarckian heredity: through consciousness which a population would impulse its own evolution in reaction to the environment, encoding adaptations and especially instincts in a certain direction, modifying moral and aesthetic sensibilities and changing our criteria for love partners: instincts and intelligence become their own evolutionary engines.<p>This is probably how human species starting from some threshold in brain size (say, 1000 cubic centimeters perhaps) have continued to develop despite being effectively immune to predation through their tools and team work. One had to be familiar with raw food to know the effects of cooking on consciousness and the brain at large, and even fathom what its suden adoption would imply for evolution, it being the key to explain the nature of the anatomical change we underwent.<figure><figcaption>The axolotl, a large tadpole breeding in the larval stage</figcaption><a role=presentation target=_blank href=/Images/biology/ecology/rosarot-axolotl.jpg><img src=/Images/biology/ecology/rosarot-axolotl.jpg srcset="/Images/biology/ecology/rosarot-axolotl.jpg 768w, /Images/biology/ecology/rosarot-axolotl_hu50e2cf1589636c02c58efc0bad32dc24_170721_604x0_resize_q95_lanczos.jpg 604w, /Images/biology/ecology/rosarot-axolotl_hu50e2cf1589636c02c58efc0bad32dc24_170721_400x0_resize_q95_lanczos.jpg 400w, /Images/biology/ecology/rosarot-axolotl_hu50e2cf1589636c02c58efc0bad32dc24_170721_200x0_resize_q95_lanczos.jpg 200w" loading=lazy alt="The axolotl, a large tadpole breeding in the larval stage" title="The axolotl, a large tadpole breeding in the larval stage" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, (max-width: 600px) 50vw, 400px" width=768px height=358px style=--height-limit:358px></a></figure><p>Our species in its present state, especially the white and Asian race, has what can be called a tendency to neoteny.

So much so that a proportion of girls start bleeding at 9 now, and <strong>getting pregnant at 10</strong>.<p>Dentist Dr. Jack Cuozzo, from a literals Christian perspective, has found the key to the mystery. Studying the fossils as a dentist, he revealed many anomalies not congruent with the interpretations of paleontologists, especially regard to the growth rate and supposed age of the fossils. It has also revealed false reconstructions that no one with a basic knowledge of anatomy could have done in good conscience&mldr; revealed alterations and damage done to the fossils themselves with the obvious aim of forcing fossils to submit to their desires and to depict Neandertals as inferior. The fanatics of the theory of evolution, who like all fanatics react with violence and denial to any evidence of errors of their doctrines. These are serious accusations, but widely documented.<p>But the reddest herrings <strong>concerned the age of the fossils</strong>: Dental and bone morphology indicate either a strong precocity and speed of growth even superior to that of apes&mldr; a much, much longer growth period than ours.<br>We could give the example of a morphologically very young crane, but the jaw was well developed (indicating weaning), and the milk teeth showed signs of extensive wear which did not correspond to the estimated age.

In all cases, wear is attributed to unknown lifestyle agents yet undiscovered in current populations, however primitive. In his words: <strong>&ldquo;Age or ape !&rdquo;</strong><p>We used to estimate age by the number of deciduous and permanent teeth by assuming the eruption schedule of modern populations for these prehistoric men and ignoring signs of dental wear or cranial development. In the 1980s people still wondered if Neandertals could even talk!<br>Cuozzo&rsquo;s second discovery was the typical Neandertal morphology not being a simian trait we would have lost from the apes that prehistoric men preserved, nor the result of a very rapid growth, but the result of a multi-century growth instead. In other words: Protracted growth or unbelievably accelerated maturation in the same amount of time as us.<p>Many people ignore it but we continue to grow after puberty: though in a slowed down fashion (in absence of disease or deficiency) bone mineralization continues, in particular on long bones (limbs) and the face, causing an elongation of the face. We are all born with a very small face in relation to the head, a ratio increasing with age from some level of retrognathism (pushed backwards) in babies and fetuses to the flat face of maturity, to a forward extension on older people. As he explains:<blockquote><p>What Happens to the Craniofacial Structure of Humans Who Live Past a hundred years", if one mathematically projected the bone profile one would get if one could continue to live past the canonical ages of 120 years, considering contemporary growth rates one would find back Neandertal-like features. The Neandertals were the old people of the Bible just after the Fall, before and just after the Flood, when mankind began to live shorter and shorter lives.</blockquote><p>However, the theory of bone thickening such as the suborbital bulges (brow ridges) as a structural compensation of the mechanical constraints exerted by jaw muscles over time is wrong, even though they are indeed rarely found today and thus the progressive diminution in fossiles would match well a corresponding shrinking of the life time as the Bible and numerous other texts (Egyptian, Summerian, Greeks).

However it is patently wrong that chimpanzees tire easily, on the opposite their arms strain for a considerable time while moving from branch to branch, sustaining a body weight for extended periods. We descend from Neanderthals which, that we know for certain due to studies and artifacts found, that they did not lack in fine motor control in any way. Yet possessed ape-like strength, as estimated from bones.<br>We may have developped smaller fibers allowing for selective activation and finer movements, but to deduce a loss of explosivity makes no sense, as it would imply the impossibility of activating more smaller units at once. <em>Cortical inhibition</em>, in the sense of limiting ourselves for no reason, can not be an evolutionary feature as most of time our muscle mass would be dead weight to carry: if evolution needed more strength, we would have discarded muscle mass (a fortiori our <em>fat</em>). We should be able to access 100% of our strength on command.<p>Cortical inhibition is explained <em>an unconscious mechanism stopping ourselves from using 100% of our strength and rip our muscles to shreds</em>, sinews and tendons asunder, while the better protein composition of animals doesn&rsquo;t mind. This plus the higher mechanical advantage their longer muscular attachments provided both Neanderthals too and apes, would explain at least the two times increase in overall strength, and probably more.<p>Next, Neanderthals were shorter than us.

While our sense of aesthetics can be fickle or subject to conditioning, evolution favors this kind of efficient body. Later European Nordid types, such as Hallstatt Nordids and Trønders, presenting traits in comparison highly neotenic (such as a pronunced high forehead, reduced browridge), should not be interpreted as signs of the arrival of a new species, or worse, God forbid, the unholy union of frail Nigger blood and brutish-looking Neanderthals.<p>Instead those new types, coexisting with the Cro-Magnoids Coon labelled <q>Upper paleolithic survivors</q> presenting much closer characteristics, with more robust-looking skulls, proportionally smaller foreheads and longer faces (but larger as well relative to the head), reflects what ageing does while our lifetime became too short for classical Neanderthal traits to develop fully at their initial speed. That neoteny in and of itself is no sign of degeneracy, quite the opposite: Neanderthals matured much more slowly and at any given age maintained traits from earlier stages of maturity. Typically children were born <strong>lookling like overgrown foetus</strong>. In terms of lifespan, we are born, breed and die as kids, almost neonates. The comparison with the axolotl is much more than an humoristic analogy.<p>Conversely, those while those that do reach maturity demonstrate undeniable Neanderthal blood, it might also indicate accelerated <em>ageing</em>. Looking old and mature when most hope to live exactly a mere tenth of what our genetic is still mostly programmed for, <em>is not good a sign at all</em>.<p>We must consider, that nearly Neanderthals we found with accentuated mature traits were not adults but extremely old people, which to cite the late Dr Cuozzo, <q>would look very funny</q>.

Then Africans started diverging sensibly in their evolutionary path, their brain size stagnating when ours soared.<ul class="center aside"><li><a role=presentation target=_blank href=/Images/biology/prognathism_chimp2.webp><img src=/Images/biology/prognathism_chimp2_huc0b077f6910b4b04260e993abb4d53b2_427432_800x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp srcset="/Images/biology/prognathism_chimp2_huc0b077f6910b4b04260e993abb4d53b2_427432_800x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 800w, /Images/biology/prognathism_chimp2_huc0b077f6910b4b04260e993abb4d53b2_427432_604x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 604w, /Images/biology/prognathism_chimp2_huc0b077f6910b4b04260e993abb4d53b2_427432_400x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 400w, /Images/biology/prognathism_chimp2_huc0b077f6910b4b04260e993abb4d53b2_427432_200x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 200w" loading=lazy sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, (max-width: 600px) 50vw, 400px" width=800px height=764px style=--height-limit:764px></a><li><a role=presentation target=_blank href=/Images/biology/chimps_elongated_faces2.webp><img src=/Images/biology/chimps_elongated_faces2_hu41382d0fa498c55420d078c90de1dde3_687912_800x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp srcset="/Images/biology/chimps_elongated_faces2_hu41382d0fa498c55420d078c90de1dde3_687912_800x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 800w, /Images/biology/chimps_elongated_faces2_hu41382d0fa498c55420d078c90de1dde3_687912_604x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 604w, /Images/biology/chimps_elongated_faces2_hu41382d0fa498c55420d078c90de1dde3_687912_400x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 400w, /Images/biology/chimps_elongated_faces2_hu41382d0fa498c55420d078c90de1dde3_687912_200x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 200w" loading=lazy sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, (max-width: 600px) 50vw, 400px" width=800px height=779px style=--height-limit:779px></a></ul><p>Before that, we see that facial traits were even more robust on average, more prognathes and accentued. It makes sense that our intelligence increased, our lifespan must have slowly extended past that of chimpanzees as well, reaching at most 150 years, the theoretical maximum of today with medicine and proper food, in the best conditions. Before the classical Neanderthal traits emerged, European hominins had more accentued traits, a flatter forehead and

According to a drug addict, giving up cooking is even more difficult than for heroin. It is not improbable if we imagine a people both uninformed and hospitable, that cooking swept the world almost instantaneously as far as fossil records are concerned, so on the scale of a few thousand years.<p>With animals as well as human beings, we observe a difference between the cooked state and the natural raw state, proportional to the size of the brain&mldr; to the capacity for introspection and metacognition. Your intellect has to be able to control and regulate your deranged impulses. Animals fed cooked food without the support of recipes (such as dog food) specially designed to reduce the immediate effect on health, for the most part, will eat whatever they find and die quite quickly of disease, violence, rather spectacularly.<p>Although human behavior is greatly altered, animal behavior are even more so, due to their impulsivity, due to a lack of a metacognition and self-control. It would make sense that people with a bigger brain and more advanced physiology, without our frustrations and still much closer to energy, would be able to buffer the effect of an initially slight alteration to their diet ?<p>Thus people would have had memories from centuries of mental stability, and might have enjoyed yet more centuries after starting cooking. Then the next generations would suffer more, and more, and more, and more. As their sexual instincts went unbounded cooked groups ended up outbreeding the rest.<p>Since the old age of patriarchs (in whichever era they really lived) appears confirmed by science, we should start to consider the Bible (along with a few other texts) not as figments of the imagination, but as sometimes literal sometimes symbolic retelling of the prehistory of Man, condensing the sequence of events from the First Age to the Flood and modern times.<p>Since we know the precise dates of death and ages of every patriarch, we can compute the number of years from the Fall to the Flood, to 1656, over
<a href=https://answersingenesis.org/bible-timeline/timeline-for-the-flood/ rel="external nofollow" target=_blank>ten generations</a>. We see in the list of patriarchs that from Adam to Noah, everyone had a lifespan of roughly 1000 years, with no discernible degradation in vitality. But let us first start at the beginning, with Genesis.<p>From 2:9 to 2:17, God explicitely allows Adam to eats from all trees from the Garden, including the free from the Tree of Life, with the express exception of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and <em>only</em> this one. Moreover in ℣17 God warns of the consequence, namely that by eating this fruit Adam <q>would certainly certainly die</q>. However the form used is <q>תָּמֽוּת׃</q>, which is the simple imperfect, <em>not an imperative or jussive</em> thus does not express an order or a wish from God, nor a threat, but the
<a tooltip="Verb Imperfect, Hebrew Grammar" href=https://uhg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/verb_imperfect.html rel="external nofollow" target=_blank>simple description of what is to come in the indefinite future</a>.<p>Then, when after the temptation of the serpent (which is a symbol ambiguous between chaos and rebirth), Eve sees that the fruit (intellect), as the serpent told her, was also desirable for gaining wisdom. That wasn&rsquo;t a lie, as indeed intelligence is a form of wisdom, but of which kind ? Then immediately, bashfulness appears in paradise (3:6), followed by the very explicit exposition of the fallen human condition now alloted to the couple, and the expulsion from Eden.<p>This knowledge of good and evil</q>, representing intellectual intelligence, which is part of Nature (human nature in particular) but God (destiny). Intelligence is part of divine beings themselves, as claimed by the serpent in book 3:4 <em>but confirmed by God/angels in verset 22</em>, so that we know the serpent was not lying&mldr;<p>Before the Fall, men were mostly vegetarians, as are apes, their amount of animal proteins being nearly negligeable, never more than 5%. Then God created the woman (actually for the second time). As 2:24 implies (<q>and they become <em>one flesh</em></q>), <em>sexuality was meant to exist before the Fall</em>, but a different kind, without guilt, <em>without desire</em> and without the typical heterosexual fixation of females on males, which is listed by God to Eve in 3:16 (<q>Your desire will be for your husband</q> as a consequence of her new fallen condition.<p>Lest we conclude the God and angels from Genesis are actually evil and mean, unwilling to share their divinity (yet unable to put that damn tree anywhere else, or just immediately cast out Man after its creation if that was the plan all along), God intended intelligence to develop only after transcendendal wisdom had been aquired, implying a certain level of extrasensory maturity to wield the intellectual power with responsability.<p>We must therefore assume the eating of that fruit and fall in a degraded form of intellect (and thus, of sexuality) refers to an accident, a fundamental change causing our dissociation from God&rsquo;s grace.<p>The consequence of that Fall, are as follow:<ul><li>Fertility goes out of control (<q>I will multiply your sorrow and conception</q>) and the whole process of childbearing from conception to delivery becomes painful (alluding not just to labor, as is often mistranslated)<li>Not relying on fruit trees anymore but having to toil to produce cereals<sup id=fnref:8><a href=#fn:8 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>8</a></sup>, while mysteriously the soil is cursed to loose its fertility<li>Hyper-intellectualization leads to the loss of sexual innocence, thus the disconnection from energy and gradual loss of capability for transcendence<li>Women are condemned to a purely reproductive sexuality.</ul><p>We undeniably see here the avatars of <strong>cooking</strong>.<br>God didn&rsquo;t change change Adam&rsquo;s body much if at all, since for ten generations him and his descent lived just as long as one another, not is it said that he was immortal in heaven. On the contrary, it&rsquo;s logical to assume he was meant to become immortal at some point after eating from the right tree, whenever he wanted, and that his newly-found mortality is not caused by an exterior God but by Man&rsquo;s estrangement from Nature, as a result from his own action. Eating cereals just doesn&rsquo;t happen without cooking, for this probably not refered to sweet corn or raw sprouts.<p>Before the fall, men were not fated to die, implying that ageing did not happen (or nowhere near as quickly as today) and that at least true apotheosis (the <strong>impossibility</strong> to die) was well in reach within one&rsquo;s lifetime:<blockquote id=eternal cite=https://henrycenter.tiu.edu/2018/05/was-adam-created-mortal-or-immortal-getting-beyond-the-labels/>This understanding of Genesis 2–3 fits well with Augustine’s three categories for human mortality before the fall, after the fall, and after consummation: <strong>possible not to die, not possible not to die, and not possible to die</strong> (City of God, XXII.30). Adam before the fall was not doomed to die. Yet, Adam before the fall also did not have the consummated/glorified body, <em>the fullness of the living forever tied to the tree of life</em>. Thus, Adam before the fall was still awaiting <em>confirmation in eternal life</em>. Adam, if he had obeyed, would have attained to the consummated/glorified body without having to pass through death.</blockquote><cite>Joshua van Ee—<a href=https://henrycenter.tiu.edu/2018/05/was-adam-created-mortal-or-immortal-getting-beyond-the-labels/ rel="external nofollow" target=_blank>Was Adam Created Mortal or Immortal?

He gave us (instead of striking us dead from disobeying Him and natural laws in general, as he should have), <em>profitting from long lives to repent on our sin and perhaps change our ways</em>. Only much later, right before the Flood, did God decide that enough was enough, not only did mankind not understood any lesson in this reprieve.<p>The unfolding of our history as it occured, was no more than a mere accident, a dramatic and unforeseen byproduct of three things:<ul><li>The pathological psychology created by dietary poisoning<li>Our god-given gift of intelligence and freewill, the extension of the capacity of all intelligent animals for self-control, the delaying and amending the realization of instinctive impulses<li>Our hands, which allowed for technology.</ul><p>The issue was, that past a certain threshold, we humans have been relying on the extrasensory to control the capacity of our intellect which aided by our hands, had now the capacity to alter our environment to a higher extent than any other species so far in history. Other animals have had either the intelligence to use fire, anatomical skill for manipulation even at a large scale (social insects razing whole forests), or the environment to produce a lasting culture&mdash;otherwise diet alterations can not cumulate to the individual&mdash; but never all of these factors combined.<p>So what started as accidental poisoning, became permanent due to our intelligence now unshackled, unguided and left unchecked by the extrasensory, which does not work within those hyperexcited nervous conditions. Psychological damages stacked up through cultures and then genetics, making the species fall deeper and deeper into depravation. This led to the complete disconnection of our intellect from the metapsychic program, to such an extent that no amount of instinctive backlash (Excalibur drive) or visionary warning, could reach enough clarity to pierce through the species-wide fog of mental disease and reset diet and mental equilibrium to their natural state.<div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><blockquote cite=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_color>However, more recent ancient DNA research has identified human remains much older than the Neolithic period with the OCA2 mutation for blue eyes.

This suggested a more protracted time between the eruption of these teeth than found in today’s children. Today’s children have their first and second primary molars erupt about 9 months to one year apart. These two teeth in the Engis child look like they were separated by a much longer time frame than that. <strong>This is what protracted eruption means: more years between tooth eruption</strong>.<p>The question that remains is, what happens when there is extensive wear of all the biting surfaces of the teeth and the face doesn’t stay the same length but, instead, gets longer or increases in facial height? This happened in Neanderthals. Does this represent overcompensation? Would it mean a higher rate of the adult passive tooth eruption process with very rapid bone build-up on the lower border of the lower jaw in the average Neanderthal life span of 45 years, 36 or 40 years? <em>Or could it be the regular process of compensation at a normal or slower rate of passive eruption with an average or slower rate of bone build-up on this border over a much longer lifetime?</em> We will discuss this later.</blockquote><cite>—Buried Alive</cite>

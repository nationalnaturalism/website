It means that the other dimension from which souls originate, is <em>fundamentally good</em>, and embodies the concept of order itself. In any case, all psychic phenomena by their very nature obey spiritual order, as they emanate from a higher order of reality which is the very source and essence of order and meaning. As such evil ghosts can not exist any more than evil magic. Because evil is not a &ldquo;thing&rdquo;, it is the absence of good, active disruption of spiritual energies. Evil is <strong>spiritual disorder per se</strong>.<br>Which is to say, <em>black magic is nonsense</em>.<p>In truth, the metapsychic dimension wholly transcends our own: both below and above it, so that everything has a purpose in our material dimension too, even catastrophe. The key difference between the two levels of reality, is that <strong>fate</strong> (or karma) in our lowly plane acts mostly through chance occurrences and physical laws. Except when it doesn&rsquo;t and a paranormal phenomena erupts, allowing for a direct appliance of <em>negentropy</em>, a literal deus ex machina. <strong>Hence it includes a natural moral limit</strong>, a sort of cosmic circuit breaker shutting off psychic abilities if used for endeavors not conducive to a higher harmony, or to put it simply for <q>evil</q>. And because metapsychics is the realm of destiny, and can not be used against its very purpose, even unknowingly. It also implies that one can not receive anything one isn&rsquo;t already ready for or able to process it: The <dfn tooltip="This instance would act as a kind of interface between the metasexual energy and physical or sexual libido, between the metapsychic and the (ordinary) psychic or mental, between the archetype and its interpretation, like a converter in a computer ensuring transformation from analog information to the digital data.">Over-Id</dfn>
filters out the messages from the other dimension that we can not assimilate, ensuring that a positive outcome for the destinies of everyone.<br>That is also why we prefer the term <em>magic</em>, to &ldquo;psychic powers&rdquo;. Science&rsquo;s attempt to prove the paranormal came with the downside of treating it as one more unknown substance or energy susceptible yet to fall into the quantifiable, the measurable. Early 20th concepts most reek of this <dfn tooltip="1. characterized by or having an exaggerated belief in the principles and methods of science, 2. of, pertaining to, or characterized by scientism">scientistic</dfn>
mindset.<p>But the paranormal is forever outside the bound of intellectual control: magic is a divine and primordial force that creates reality on the most fundamental level, <strong>a living force</strong>. And to control it one must relinquish any desire to master it, but <em>let it control you ever more deeply</em>. <em>Magic has a life of its own</em>, that mirrors our deeper, divine self. That is way the only to gain control of it, is to relinquish control, and let it change you.<blockquote>But it&rsquo;d be just as correct to say it&rsquo;s heaven speaking to us, that being able to read the future is a harmonious act of man&rsquo;s being. In other words, prediction is a natural consequence in the wave of the present. It wears the guise of nature, you see. But such powers cannot be used from an attitude that prestates aims and purposes. Does a chip caught in the way say where it&rsquo;s going ? There&rsquo;s no cause and effect in the oracle. Causes become occasions of convections and ocnfluences, places where the currents meet.<br>Accepting prescience, <em>you fill your being with concepts repugnant to the intellect.

Finally, because the material universe is not closed on itself, then <em>the fundamental posulates of thermodynamics are wrong</em>, and the speed of light needs not be an absolute limit, nor is the world doomed to die a cold death in the distant future anymore.<h3 id=scientific-explanations class=headings><a href=#scientific-explanations>Scientific explanations</a></h3><p>To begin to understand the general nature of psychic phenomena, or how our consciousness interacts with the material world, we need a few notions about physics. Phenomenon such as tsunamis or groundswells, asteroid falls, or on the small scale I-Ching coin tossing, all obey fluid dynamics, in that their their overall outcome tend toward a given statistical repartition, for the first obeying fluid dynamics and seismology, then orbital dynamics, and lastly simple statistics for the coins.<p>But the principle is the same: that an outcome will be observed eventually is certain, but how and where, can not be. Quantum physics set hard theoretical limit to the knowledge scientific apparatuses can get from observation, even with an impossibly large sets of captors and detectors miniaturized to an impossibly small atomic scale, so knowing everything in a given moment would not be enough to divine the exact state of everything in the next moment.<p>On the particle level the world is chaotic by nature and anything is physically possible, however ludicrously unlikely. This is the difference between the particle world and ours: Physical laws arise as the result of statistical averages between interactions on the quantum level.<p class=important>Physical laws are not absolute laws of nature, but merely statistical averages.<p>The behavior of one or a few local particles is intrinsically unpredictable, and cannot be pinpointed precisely until observed, due to the <em>wave-particle duality</em>, with wide margins of freedom and counterintuitive phenomena, like teleportation: because math shows its probability to be at a specific place isn&rsquo;t zero, it just happens. But waves can only represented by <em>fields of probabilities</em>. So, the more particles we consider, the less impactful odd behaviors become.<p>Though averages hold true on average, as the Schrödinger cat&rsquo;s thought experiment exemplifies it is possible to conceive and mount situations where a single behavior (here, a particle emitted or not) decides the outcome of a group of quadrillions of particles, allowing &ldquo;big&rdquo; systems (in practice no more than a few thousands atoms) to enter quantum states of superposition. Magic acts as a kind of Maxwell&rsquo;s demon, and <em>disproves the Second Law of thermodynamics</em>.<blockquote class=aside cite=https://www.schoolofpe.com/blog/2017/02/principles-of-thermodynamics-for-engineering-applications.html><p>First Principle :<br>The most important law of physics is the conservation of energy.

But what we actually mean in physics by &ldquo;energy&rdquo; is often not heat per se but the free enthalpy of a system, the maximum work from it. To extract work you need a difference of potential in whatever form, which leads to a change in energy distribution or form, and an unavoidable even if infinitesimal <em>loss in heat</em>: That is the second principle. Systems <em>statistically</em> degrade from the highest states of order, of uneven distribution, that is why we can extract work. And as the distribution evens up, the level of randomness of a system, hence heat only goes from hot to cold places. This is the <strong>third law</strong>. Less and less happen happen <em>spontaneously</em>, meaning without adding more work in the system, instead of extracting it.<p>On the particle level the second law is routinely violated with excited atoms releasing photons of light then absorbed by an even more excited atom. But on our scale systems behave <strong>probabilistically</strong> as the behavior of individual particles evens out. Balls, however slippery and oddly shaped, always fall down a precipice. Some stray balls do play tricks, bouncing with an angle and dropping on the very top against energy gradients but the bigger and interactive a system the less meaningful any deviation becomes.<p>This is the current view of physics: total energy from the Big Bang is limited and constant, and available work perpetually decreases, until the final and inevitable heat death of the universe. But this materialist viewpoint hinges on several unfounded or patently wrong hypotheses:<ul><li>The universe must be finite with no outside to lose energy to or gain it from.<li>No process can be 100% efficient and entropy-free providing work (movement) without repair in heat.</ul><p>With any of these two postulates wrong, <em>a perpetual movement becomes possible</em>, either by constant perfect recycling of the same energy potential differences, or a new source of disequilibrium. The Psi can be described as a force influencing the quantum states of a great many isolated particles so make the impossibly unlikely happen, such atoms of oxygen changing into gold or

I argue that all paranormal activities are extrasensory perception and thus inherently benevolent, in the sense of <strong>always acting for the greater good</strong>, because they are living symbols from the other dimension merely taking on the shape of living things in order to convey their message.<p>Ghosts and fairies and UFOs are symbols taking on a physical albeit temporary existence, a magic phenomena made possible through can be summed as as unconscious psychokinesis of either one person, or a people, or the Collective Unconscious at large. In fact, <strong>the source needs not to be human</strong>as we do not have the monopoly on souls or psychic presences. Forests or highly magical natural places, either teeming with life or somehow at the crossing of geological energies (underground caverns, deep mines) might be possessing a life of their own. Thus echoing age-long animist beliefs, which at the light of actual extrasensory experiences, <strong>are most certainly true</strong>, although the correct understanding of what a &ldquo;soul&rdquo; or a &ldquo;person&rdquo; is, has been lacking.<p>Because the inherent goal of archetypes is always to enable constructive change, so they can not be associated with Ego or evil, the paranormal could potentially <em>appear</em> as harmful, but only <em>if and only if we deserve it, and if that is the best outcome in everyone&rsquo;s destiny</em>. However, testimonies of truly hurtful hurtful phenomena seem so rare and unreliable, that it is mostly theoretical, and might be explained by the fact that <em>dead people don&rsquo;t improve</em>.

There are masters or <q>gifted subjects&lt;/q, but they <em>remain even in their institutions a small minority</em>, and for one master clearly seeing a <em>tiny bit</em> In the future, most have no power whatsoever. There is a very clear distinction between the spirit, in its material, cerebral component, and the soul, which is our true connection to the other dimension, the part that survives after death in one form or another.<p>Religions throughout the world have always <em>mostly</em> been a <em>desperate search for the transcendental dimension</em> lost as a result of eating a cooked diet and experiencing sexuality according to the procreative paradigm. The appearance of these phenomena, of the supernatural in the midst of normal life, depends intrinsically on the <em>level of love</em> available around you, which has to do with upbringing and religion, and little to do with the famed meditation techniques.<br>So this is not to say meditative efforts never develop <q>supramundane</q> abilities&mldr; siddhis, powers. Up to things like levitation. But when they do it is due to the practitioner, not the practice. Meditation without addressing cooking is akin to the myth of Sisyphus (

Of coital heterosexuality. Impulses largely cease to aim at their original purpose, leading to unconscious rejections (Excalibur impulses) and very difficult to conceptualize from a lack of energy.<p>While permissiveness in love has always allowed these countries to bathe in much more love than in the (current) West, especially inside respected institutions (monasteries), they never developed a theory about the role of love.

Those movements are often driven by masters born in the East (at least initially), but take place in Europe and are populated by practitioners born in Europe <em>in a western moral and sexual atmosphere</em>, marked by its fixation on the binary heteronormative couple and completely disconnected by the sexual freedom which was the norm in Tibet, even though culture never codified this understanding in doctrines.<p>In the West once imported the same traditions become deceptive and misleading by channeling expectations where nothing can come out of them because the doctrines do not come along the Tibetan psychic structures, <em>byproducts of their familial model and untold cultural unsaid assumptions</em>, which can not be imported or verbalized. The disciple learns a diversity of tools <em>to self-lobotomize</em> on the desired mode, and equipped with many tools close to cognitive and Jungian psychology, he will proceed in good faith to <em>the eradication of these doubts and unconscious suspicions</em>, to mold himself in a specific human type with a very sharp and crystal clear brain, <em>but without the slightest connection to the divine.</em><p><strong>The worst personal experiences can then be justified:</strong> &ldquo;this is karma&rdquo;, or simply the more <q>mature</q> reflex: one must accept that it hurts and move on. Crushing one&rsquo;s infantile reaction of disappointment and anger is a cowardly dishonest reaction, in order to safeguard an image of sanctity. In reality meaningless NPC fates, diseases and pain, demonstrate that <em>God obviously doesn&rsquo;t like what you do</em>. Masters camouflage their arrogance and ignorance of the world with their false wisdom. Heterosexual Tantrists aim to fuel their spiritual practice with unchanged coital excitation while metapsychoanalysis teaches the pointlessness of such belief.<p id=tantric_probleml>But coital desire and all emotions (along with all emotions related to it is completely unusable, a drive of purely bodily origin. There is no <em>metapsychic energy</em> in such an urge. Far from gaining powers tantrikas delude themselves in a false belief of a spiritualized coitus, uprooting with self-brainwashing any negative but salutary feedback our Unconscious mind produces in our mind in the form of doubt, depression and lack of motivation, and finally become empty <em>tantric robots</em>.<br>At the core, the error of tantrism is to consider all body or mind impulses as &ldquo;energy&rdquo;. It is the divide which Freud and Jung had: Freud&rsquo;s libido is an impulse on the nervous or material, superficial level, which <strong>might</strong> derive from a higher spiritual source, Jung&rsquo;s metapsychic energy. But also might not. Drives (sex drive in particular) can be mostly or solely mechanical and degenerate in nature, disconnected from spirituality. Thus acting on them only further destroys any chance of developing magic. Some (most today !) relationships or fantasies are inherently spiritually destructive, and cannot be &ldquo;redirected&rdquo; in any way. <strong>They must be discarded</strong>.<h4 id=drugs class=headings><a href=#drugs>Drugs</a></h4><p>Compared to what is happening in the East, in terms of exploring the horizon of human existence, there is simply nothing in the West. All spiritual culture has disappeared. No pagan or neo-Pagan cult of any kind, in Greece or the rest of the world, understands anything about the laws of nature or has anything in common with Plato&rsquo;s teachings, near or far. Systematically, attempts at neo-Pagan renewal, driven by the intellect, end up in a flat ritualism. Sexuality is relegated to a strictly procreative role, except for Evola&rsquo;s disciples, who fall into an adulation of coitus identical to that of tantrism, whether the Hindu or Tibet one.<br>In absence of meditation, we resort to drugs, like mushrooms or the smoke from the geothermal vents that are supposed to have given their visions to the oracle of Delphi. We have to consider that brain mechanics is what it is after several millions of years of evolution, even before animals since some neurotransmitters are found in plants, in strangely similar functions (neuron networks?). As with the example of morphine, no substance (such as DMT produced by the pineal gland and ayahuasca) has a function <em>in itself</em>, they only work in relation to tens of thousands of other compounds, with their individual effect on a brain being an accidental product of evolution.<p class=important>Caffeine is not <q>liquid attention</q>, as DMT is not <q>liquid transcendence</q>.<p>So-called <q>entheogens</q> act by artificially activating the brain functions involved in the faculties of vision, without of course the extrasensory content itself. This is an attempt to provoke the associated visions and sensations (<q>being part of something bigger</q> etc) as would attest John C. Lilly
<a href=https://cosmicegg.org/ECCO.pdf rel="external nofollow" target=_blank>with his deities and extra-galactic entities</a>. What happens in those cases, is the random, dry activation of cerebral functions in isolation, functions that should otherwise be used by the extrasensory. Drugs manifests a need for escapism, following the loss of transcendence. We can take the example of wine during mass, shamans, festivals linked to Dionysus or Shiva etc. The only result will be a strong dependence or worse, lasting nervous disorders.<br>We evolved magic through evolution, they must thus be accessed without any artificial means, <strong>through love</strong>. Messing with such an impossibly complex mechanic with a mere sprinkling of totally random chemicals is ridiculous, and reeks of reductionist, of associating.<div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><blockquote><p>Many experiments in free response precognition have been published by independent research teams, but the largest collections of relevant studies were produced by two sources.

Ergo, everything written below still stands as strong, and time could only add more exemples from molecular and genetic studies.<br>Pasteur was the first to use the term <q>virus</q> to designate the pathogenic action of bacteria he had discovered in the field of the microscope. At the beginning of the century, increasingly sophisticated filters, followed by ultracentrifugation, X-ray diffraction and electrophoresis techniques, made it possible to establish the existence of very small particles, which carry an indefinitely reproducible infectious power, although they lack autonomous vital functions.<p>More recently, molecular biology and the electron microscope have made it possible to determine and visualize the exact structures of a large number of viruses, as well as the mechanisms of their multiplication and their action on a molecular scale. Thus, the mystery of these infinitesimal beings which had remained hypothetical for so long, associated with so many illnesses and diseases, and even unbearable tragedies such as smallpox or polio in the past, and AIDS today, seems solved.<p>This knowledge gives us hope to find ways to fight either preventively by acting on the immune system with vaccines, or curatively by directly inhibiting viral activity by molecular means with antivirals. However, the prolonged failure of these techniques in the case of HIV, despite the importance of the technological apparatus implemented, as well as the contradictions that remain between theory and facts, should prompt us to ask ourselves a number of questions.<p>The basis of the reasoning behind current research is in fact the legacy of an era when the superstitions attached to the fear of contagion and major epidemics were barely overcome. The image that the medicine of that time gave us of the virus, considered a priori as a pathogenic agent, harmful by definition, is not necessarily the only one possible. The current trend is to consider the disease more as an imbalance between the host and the aggressor, giving more importance to the factors likely to decrease the resistance of the organism. A further step would be to look for the meaning of the viral phenomenon in itself, without any emotional connotation.<p>There are many viruses in the natural world that do not manifest themselves as a nuisance. Even in humans, many viral diseases occur mostly in a frugal or asymptomatic form. In the case of poliomyelitis, for example, serological studies in epidemic settings have shown that nervous system involvement occurs in only a very small percentage of infected persons.<p>In children, primary infection with herpes virus usually occurs inapparently, and in adults, complications are exceptional, with the majority of individuals being healthy carriers. In the different classes of viral hepatitis, there are also a large number of completely latent forms; the benign forms usually end with complete regeneration of the hepatocytes, with restoration of a normal architecture thanks to a remarkable conservation of the reticulum during the course of the disease.<p>Similarly, the Epstein-Barr virus is detectable in most cases only by hematological and serological examinations, and is found in the majority of African children, whereas it causes Burkitt&rsquo;s sarcoma in only one case in ten thousand, probably in cooperation with various cofactors; when it triggers mononucleosis, this is usually not serious. The rabies virus itself develops the classic symptoms in some people and not in others, and the reasons for these differences are still unknown.<p>The situation is similar in animals: avian influenza manifests itself in domestic ducks and quails in the form of coughing, sneezing, and swelling around the beak, leading to significant mortality, whereas it remains mild or inapparent in other wild or domestic species. The swine influenza virus, considered dangerous, even fatal for young pigs infected by their mothers, is found in pigs from different regions where it is only sporadically accompanied by clinical manifestations.<p>Many epidemiologists are of the opinion that most viruses are widely distributed in all living species, including humans, but only occasionally manifest themselves by pathological symptoms, under the effect of triggering factors still not well known.<p>Insofar as the number of inapparent forms and healthy carriers turns out to be greater than that of the serious forms, there is nothing to prevent, at least from a theoretical point of view, a reversing of the classical model of reasoning. Rather than considering the viral disease as the natural outcome of the invasion by the virus and being surprised that the virus can be present when nothing is happening, one could postulate that the asymptomatic form of the viral invasion is the normal form of a natural phenomenon, the pathological forms being only the result of an accidental evolution due to certain other pathogenic factors.<p>Moreover, if it is a phenomenon not harmful in itself and belonging to the complex equilibrium mechanisms characterizing biological reality, it should be possible to attribute to it a precise function (a teleological meaning), at the very least a function that is useful to the host, even if this possibility does not yet seem to have been envisaged in the classical conceptions.<p>To illustrate this in a somewhat trivial way, let us take the case of the rockets used to put satellites into orbit: if the launch fails in one case out of ten, an uninformed observer, struck more by the accidents than by the successes, much less impressive, could think the purpose of the operation is to destroy the satellite and that this purpose is missed in the nine other cases; all the operations conducted by the engineers and technicians would be explained for this observer as well as if he knew their real purpose, apart from the impression of a great quantity of failures and useless efforts; without knowing the real intentions behind the facts he can observe, that is to say, without knowing the satellites can have any usefulness, such an observer would believe it useful to intervene by destroying the satellite with simple explosives rather than to join in the work that represents its launching.<p>Viruses cause significant problems in about one in a hundred cases. They remain frightening if they have no other meaning than to cause disease. On the other hand, if our postulate were confirmed and if we could attribute a useful function to the viral process on the one hand, while identifying on the other hand the causes of dysfunction causing the accidental danger, a very different direction of research, even therapeutic action, would unveil.<p><q>In the case of AIDS, it seemed a priori that the virus had a harmful effect in 100% of cases. It is significant that the best-placed researchers have come to believe, some ten years after its discovery, that the pathogenic activity of this retrovirus is due more to certain co-factors than to its intrinsic characteristics.<p>Faced with the general failure of the prophylactic and therapeutic means implemented, and faced with the urgency of the situation, all paths certainly deserve to be explored: the very basis of the reasoning on which medical action is founded, as each time a theory leads to failures or contradictions, must be reconsidered in the light of the knowledge acquired in the meantime and, above all, in the light of the facts that can be brought to light by new experiences.<p>This is precisely another theoretical model of the viral phenomenon Guy‑Claude Burger, a former mathematician and theoretical physicist, proposes here for the consideration of researchers open to a multidisciplinary reflection. After thirty years of unprecedented experience on genetic maladjustment to traditional food, he hopes to make a modest contribution to the general effort to curb the threatening epidemic and to advance knowledge.<h3 id=classical-model-of-the-viral-phenomenon class=headings><a href=#classical-model-of-the-viral-phenomenon>Classical model of the viral phenomenon</a></h3><p>Viruses are generally considered as pathogenic agents, devoid of life of their own and subsisting at the expense of the organisms they infect. The virion (viral particle) attaches itself to the membrane of a cell, introduces its DNA or RNA and hijacks the cell&rsquo;s genetic machinery in order to reproduce itself.<p>The new virions spread into the circulating masses and infect other cells. The host&rsquo;s immune system reacts with varying degrees of success by creating antibodies to stop the process. This is done with a certain delay or falure rate which explain the variable importance of symptoms observed in different subjects.<p>This process has no other teleological significance than the virus&rsquo; multiplication and perpetuation. It is carried out at the expense of a living species that must not, out of necessity, succumb, a fact within limits accounting for a certain balance between the harmfulness of the virus and the resistance of the species.<p>We know today the sequences of nucleotides of a great number of viruses and retroviruses, as well as the structure of their envelope and the nature of the antigens which allow the immune system to recognize them.<h3 id=classical-model-of-viral-disease class=headings><a href=#classical-model-of-viral-disease>Classical model of viral disease.</a></h3><p>Viral invasion triggers an immune system reaction that results in various symptoms: asthenia, hyperthermia, inflammation of the mucous membranes, catarrh, rashes, etc. In addition, in association with the viral process, especially in diseases of the respiratory tract, the multiplication of pathogenic bacteria is often observed.<p>Normally, this proliferation is slowed down, for example in the case of coryza, by the bacteriostatic action of the nasal mucus, but this balance seems to be broken by the action of the virus. Similarly, viral pneumonia can lead to bacterial superinfection and various complications, hence the systematic use of antibiotic therapy, although this has no effect on the viral process itself.<p>In the absence of complications, the viral disease converges spontaneously towards recovery. In some cases, it may leave sequelae (e.g., post-liver cirrhosis) or even lead to death.<p>The classical means of fighting viral diseases are prophylaxis, vaccination, rest, diet, abstention from alcohol, vitamin therapy, and antibiotics to avoid bacterial complications. More recently, various molecules blocking the mechanisms of viral multiplication, or antivirals (such as AZT), have been used, but with inconclusive results. It can be said in general that there is no satisfactory background treatment for viral diseases.<p>It is accepted that the evolution of a viral disease depends on the general condition of the patient, but the factors characterizing this condition are not yet clearly established. In a significant number of cases, viral diseases develop in a frugal or asymptomatic form. Since the viral information can remain present in infected organisms for a long time without causing any particular symptoms, the a priori contradictory concept of <q>healthy carrier</q> requires definition. This state concerns, for most viruses, the majority of individuals.<h3 id=viral-diseases-and-burgers-experiment class=headings><a href=#viral-diseases-and-burgers-experiment>Viral diseases and Burger&rsquo;s experiment.</a></h3><p>Guy‑Claude Burger, a physicist and mathematician, former assistant in theoretical physics at the University of Lausanne, was diagnosed with cancer (lymphoblastic sarcoma of the pharynx) in 1960. For about thirty years, he pursued a dietary experiment consisting of reconstituting a Paleolithic type of diet, in order to demonstrate the influence of a possible genetic maladjustment of the human organism to the data of modern nutrition.<p>Since the Neolithic period, many artifices have been introduced into food habits, such as cooking, the selection of cereals, the use of animal milk and the manufacture of dairy products, as well as the various processes used in the culinary arts in general. These processes modify the organoleptic qualities of foods so as to increase their palatability (which tends to increase their consumption) and also lead to transformations in the biochemical structures of certain nutrients (oxidation, free radicals attaching themselves to other molecules, heterocycles by heating unsaturated fatty acids, Maillard molecules resulting from the reactions between carbohydrates and proteins, etc.)<p>However, there is no evidence that the genetic data of assimilation, first constituted in contact with primitive foods, could have been adapted in a few millennia to these new food factors. A possible maladjustment of digestive enzymes, of the intestinal barrier, and of the immune system could explain the appearance of numerous disorders and diseases, as a result of the penetration into the circulating masses of molecules foreign to the functioning of the organism.<p>Paleopathology corroborates this hypothesis by demonstrating that most of the diseases whose traces we know how to recognize on the bones, did not exist or were very rare before the agricultural and culinary era. These few elements may lead us to wonder about the nature of viral diseases: how would they manifest themselves if organisms were fed according to their genetic programming?<p>Burger&rsquo;s experiment consisted precisely in observing, over periods of up to twenty years, a large number of subjects fed according to the Paleolithic model, i.e. exclusively with raw food, organically grown, neither prepared nor mixed, excluding all animal milk and all dairy products, and with a minimum of cereals and selected products. The food intake was regulated by a strict observance of the alliesthetic mechanisms (variations of the olfactory and gustatory sensations) so as to reproduce as much as possible the primitive conditions of food.<p>Burger would have noted, under these particular feeding conditions, that most viral diseases systematically present themselves in a frugal or asymptomatic form. The viral invasion and multiplication of virions, however, seem to occur under classical conditions. Indeed, Burger claims to have observed in many cases that infected subjects, even though the disease remained inapparent, developed classical symptoms within hours of ingesting traditional foods, i.e. as soon as the foreign molecules of which they could be the vectors had passed into the circulating masses.<h3 id=proposal-of-a-new-theoretical-model-of-the-viral-phenomenon class=headings><a href=#proposal-of-a-new-theoretical-model-of-the-viral-phenomenon>Proposal of a new theoretical model of the viral phenomenon</a></h3><p>If, within the framework of a Paleolithic type of diet, in principle in conformity with the genetic data of the organism, the absence or the reduction of the disorders associated with the viral affections were to be confirmed in a systematic way, the very notion of viral disease would have to be called into question.<p>A first interpretation would be to say simply that a natural diet confers a better resistance to viral aggression. However, it would also be possible to turn the problem around and stop considering the virus as a pathogenic agent in se, the pathogenicity of the phenomenon being sought rather in certain factors of genetic maladjustment to the unnatural diet.<p>More fundamentally, one should ask whether the viral phenomenon, which is widespread in the natural world, does not possess a biological function whose teleological significance is still poorly discerned by contemporary medicine, at least when it comes to the human being.<p>Burger points out in this connection that practically all viral diseases are accompanied by <q>effluents</q>: catarrh, perspiration, rashes, diarrhea, heavy urine, seborrhea, particular body odors, etc. Basing himself on these facts of current observation, on the other hand on the current data provided by enzymology, molecular biology, virology and immunology, he proposes the following hypothesis: the viral DNA or RNA would program, in addition to the mechanisms necessary to the multiplication of virions, the synthesis of proteins ensuring the evacuation of certain molecules foreign to the normal metabolism which would have accumulated in the intracellular medium.<p>It is true that retroviruses have a very restricted genome and that they produce only a small number of different proteins whose functions are already known in most cases. However, it is not excluded that a given protein has two functions, one belonging to the reproduction of the virus, the other to a process useful to the cell, still unknown. Biology has already provided more than one such surprise: many organs have multiple functions, some genes can be read with a shift of one nucleotide and give rise to two different yet functional proteins, etc.<p>It is no more unreasonable to consider, for example, the hypothesis that a viral protein can, on the one hand, exert a suppressive action on viral replication and, on the other hand, bind to foreign molecules of a given class, in order to ensure their transport outside the cell: viral multiplication would thus be linked to the concentration of foreign molecules, which would explain a self-regulation of the phenomenon such as seems to be apparent from Burger&rsquo;s clinical observations.<p>From this point of view, viruses, or at least certain viruses, should be seen as a kind of complement to the traditional immunological system: the latter ensures the synthesis of antibodies responsible for eliminating the antigens present in the circulating masses, whereas viruses would be the agents of a kind of intracellular immunology responsible for maintaining order inside the cells.<p>In other words, the virus would provide the cell with the necessary genetic complement to recognize and eliminate the molecules that it is not able to control by its own genetics, in particular the molecules that are foreign to the normal mechanisms of assimilation, introduced into the organism by the effect of different environmental factors, in particular as a result of the absorption of food containing molecules that are foreign to the genetic data of metabolism.<p>The symptoms which appear during the viral process would then reflect the difficulties encountered by the organism to get rid of these foreign molecules, more than a fight against the virus itself.<h3 id=discussion class=headings><a href=#discussion>Discussion</a></h3><p>This hypothesis seems to be in agreement with the data already known about the viral process, which it allows us to include in a coherent synthesis.<h3 id=origin-of-the-virus class=headings><a href=#origin-of-the-virus>Origin of the virus.</a></h3><p>It is generally admitted that the virus has adapted to the cell by a series of mutations obeying the laws of chance and natural selection. The virion would thus have become capable of attaching itself to certain proteins present on the cell membrane, or even of integrating into this membrane by using, for example, the mechanisms of phagocytosis to surreptitiously penetrate the plasma, and then of hijacking the cell&rsquo;s genetic machinery to its advantage.<p>It is also possible to reverse the reasoning and postulate that the cell has evolved genetically in such a way as to proceed to the synthesis of various viral particles, allowing it to transmit a genetic message to the other cells of the organism and to other individuals of the species.<p>The selection pressure is probably stronger in this second hypothesis (which would thus appear more probable), if we admit, as Burger does, that the information transmitted by the virus allows the cell to eliminate harmful molecules: in a living species whose representatives are in competition, the individuals best equipped in terms of intracellular immunology obviously have more chances of reproducing than the others.<h3 id=membrane-receptors class=headings><a href=#membrane-receptors>Membrane receptors</a></h3><p>In the first hypothesis, the virus would have acquired during its evolution the ability to bind to certain proteins present on the cell membrane.<p>In the second hypothesis, the cell would have evolved to endow the virion with proteins capable of adhering to certain membrane proteins, which it would have taken advantage of to ensure this new function.<p>The ability of a cell to synthesize a protein capable of binding to a receptor, even a distant one, appears for example in the case of hormones or antibodies, and there is nothing to prevent us from presupposing an analogous phenomenon in the case of the virus.<p>From the point of view of the quantity of information, it seems more likely that a cell can match a new protein to an element whose synthesis it has already mastered, than the reverse, i.e. that a virus can <q>succeed</q> by chance alone in synthesizing binding proteins corresponding to proteins which would be in no way related to it.<h3 id=viral-membrane-and-cell-membrane class=headings><a href=#viral-membrane-and-cell-membrane>Viral membrane and cell membrane.</a></h3><p>Similarly, a series of mutations hardly explains the ability of the virion to integrate its own membrane with that of the cell, which requires rather complex molecular mechanisms. Indeed, no process of natural selection can begin before the virus is able to enter a cell to multiply, and no process of multiplication is possible if the virus is not already able to enter a cell. It is difficult to estimate the probability of such an arrangement occurring, but it is certainly very low.<p>However, this integration phenomenon is immediately explained if we admit that the membrane of the first virus is derived from a cell membrane. This is also perfectly consistent with some virions leaving the cell where their multiplication took place <q>borrow</q> their membrane from that of their host, or rather: that the multiplying cell uses its own membrane to <q>package</q> the genetic message that it sends to its fellow cells.<h3 id=similarity-between-viral-dna-or-rna-and-cellular-dna class=headings><a href=#similarity-between-viral-dna-or-rna-and-cellular-dna>Similarity between viral DNA or RNA and cellular DNA.</a></h3><p>The remarkable identity between an important portion of the viral nucleotide sequence and that of the cellular DNA, as it is observed in retroviruses, seems difficult to attribute to chance. On the other hand, it is immediately explained if one admits that the retrovirus, in a more or less distant past, originated from the cell.<p>In DNA viruses, even if we are not dealing with identical sequences, there is nevertheless a relationship that allows the virus to hijack cellular genetics to its advantage. This <q>homology</q> can be explained either by a genetic adaptation of the virus to the cell, or by an adaptation of the cell to an existing virus, or by assuming that the viral DNA is derived, at least in part, from cellular DNA.<p>Just as the organism knows how to control the multiplication of useful bacteria, for example in the intestinal flora, it is conceivable that it could have <q>learned</q> to control certain existing viruses in order to take advantage of them: just as intestinal bacteria are useful to it by their enzymes which complete the range of enzymes provided for in the genetic make-up, viruses were able to provide an assortment of proteins useful for maintaining the integrity of the intracellular environment.<h3 id=reverse-transcriptase class=headings><a href=#reverse-transcriptase>Reverse transcriptase.</a></h3><p>The discovery of an enzyme capable of transcribing retrovirus RNA into DNA defied all predictions of biologists at the time. This viral type suddenly proved to be able to <q>predict</q> its copy by synthesizing itself the enzyme necessary to the transcription of its genetic information in the language proper to cellular genetics. Moreover, this fact seemed to contradict everything we knew about the irreversibility of the transcription of DNA into RNA in all living beings.<p>Such a phenomenon can be better explained if we postulate that the cell, by virtue of a perhaps very old mechanism inscribed in its genetic heritage, has endowed the RNA of the retrovirus with the information necessary for the synthesis of an enzyme capable of retrotranscribing it into DNA. This allows, on the one hand, the transmitting cell to export information by passing through the classic way of the RNA-polymerase, and on the other hand, the receiving cell to integrate the transmitted information at the level of its own DNA. This reasoning is only meaningful in terms of evolution if one postulates that the transmitted information is useful to the individual and to the species, in accordance with Burger&rsquo;s hypothesis.<h3 id=replication-of-viroids class=headings><a href=#replication-of-viroids>Replication of viroids.</a></h3><p>It seems that viroids, short chains of RNA consisting of only a few hundred nucleotides, studied so far in plants, reproduce thanks to the action of enzymes already present in the host cell.<p>This fact is difficult to explain if one admits that the viroid is of external origin to the cell: it implies that the viroid is able to divert enzymes in charge of other functions in the cell for its own multiplication. On the other hand, they fit perfectly into the logic of an action programmed by the cell, useful to the individual and the species according to the Burger hypothesis.<p>In this respect, it should be noted that viroids only cause symptoms in certain <q>sensitive</q> plants of a species, whereas they are also present in others without causing any harmful effects: the problem of the <q>healthy carrier</q>, which concerns the majority of individuals infected by classical viruses, is already present in these simplified viruses. Some researchers consider viroids to be <q>abnormal</q> regulatory molecules: since their action is not systematically harmful, there is reason to look for other factors responsible for triggering a pathology.<p>Nothing prevents us from thinking that these rudimentary viral particles are the result of archaic mechanisms of transmission of genetic information, the secrets of which biology has yet to reveal.<h3 id=viral-multiplication class=headings><a href=#viral-multiplication>Viral multiplication</a></h3><p>It is generally considered that the virus <q>hijacks the cell&rsquo;s genetic machinery for its own benefit</q> in order to reproduce its own genetic information a certain number of times. This statement is based on the fact that the virus induces in some cases a complete blockage of the cellular machinery, the only genes expressed being then the viral genes.<p>If one accepts that the expression of viral genes is useful to the organism and the species, one should rather say that certain cells <q>concentrate their activity on the multiplication of viral information, in order to retransmit it to the other cells of the body</q>.<p>The blocking of the normal activities of certain cells does not pose any particular problem for the organism if their number remains limited. Experience shows that such a limitation is indeed assured in the vast majority of cases.<h3 id=cellular-lysis class=headings><a href=#cellular-lysis>Cellular lysis</a></h3><p>Some viruses, such as the poliomyelitis virus, are known to cause the destruction of infected cells. As in the previous paragraph, it should be noted that the lysis of a certain number of cells dispersed in the organism does not represent an irreversible lesion if their percentage remains below a certain threshold.<p>The problem is rather to know which factors can cause this threshold to be exceeded: for example, a deficiency in the immune system, or, in accordance with Burger&rsquo;s hypothesis, an exaggerated concentration of foreign molecules stimulating the multiplication of the virus responsible for their elimination.<p>If the viral information is supposed to be useful, it does not appear unfavorable in itself that the organism <q>sacrifices</q> a limited number of cells in order to ensure their multiplication, as long as the phenomenon remains reversible, i.e. the dead cells can be replaced by operational cells. Still in the example of poliomyelitis, the number of patients presenting irreversible lesions of the neurons (alteration of the nucleus of the cells and irreversible paralysis) is about 0.25%, which is obviously insufficient to be able to consider these lesions as a consequence directly linked to the action of the virus.<p>It should also be noted that the incubation phase, during which the virus multiplies, is generally silent. In Burger&rsquo;s hypothesis, the symptoms which appear during the state period should be divided into two classes: those which result from possibly irreversible cellular destruction, and those which are caused by foreign molecules released by the cells into the circulating masses. y<p>In addition, the destruction of certain cells, as in the case of infections by the herpes virus, could be part of a general programming of the phenomenon including, for example, the formation of papules useful for the elimination of substances rejected by the cells.<h3 id=genetic-variability class=headings><a href=#genetic-variability>Genetic variability</a></h3><p>The genetic variability observed in many viruses can be accounted for by the diversity of the classes of foreign molecules whose elimination they are responsible for programming. There would be a certain analogy with the multiplicity of the different antibodies that lymphocytes know how to elaborate to recognize the different classes of antigens likely to penetrate the circulating masses. Similarly, the variability of viruses would allow intracellular immunology to cope with the various classes of foreign molecules capable of accumulating inside the cells. It is therefore questionable whether the mutations we observe are not induced by cellular genetics.<h3 id=plant-viruses class=headings><a href=#plant-viruses>Plant viruses</a></h3><p>The existence of viruses that are obviously harmful to the individual in the plant world can be explained by a kind of homeostasis at the level of the species: the survival of the species is indeed endangered if the biotope becomes unbalanced due to overpopulation. The usefulness for the species seems here to go against the usefulness for the individual. This is undoubtedly due to the fact that the survival of the individual, in the plant world, is much less important for the maintenance of the species than in the animal world, especially in the higher animals where the litters are few.<p>In this regard, it can be noted that overpopulation causes deficiencies in the humus, which in turn leads to nutritional disorders in plants. Thus, there is already a relationship between nutritional disorders and virosis in the plant kingdom. It is therefore not absurd to think that this same phenomenon could have taken, through the evolution undergone by the animal kingdom, a more elaborate form whose strategy consists in preserving the individual to favor the survival of the species.<h3 id=the-role-of-interferon class=headings><a href=#the-role-of-interferon>The role of interferon</a></h3><p>The production of interferon during the multiplication of the virion in the first cells, avoiding further multiplication in the other cells, is meaningful if we admit that transmission of the viral information to all the cells of the individual responds to a process of genetic complementation <q>foreseen</q> by the organism.<p>On the other hand, it is difficult to explain in terms of a defense mechanism as the classical model would have it: if such a defense mechanism is possible at the time of viral invasion, it is not clear why interferon would not be synthesized early enough (at a time when the organism is not yet weakened and would therefore be in a better position to defend itself), as is the case for many immunological mechanisms. Such slowness seems to contradict the laws of evolution, whereas the hypothesis of a collaboration between the virus and the cell, useful for the species, justifies perfectly the presence of a regulation mechanism allowing the virus to multiply within the adequate limits so as to avoid that all the cells of the body are infected.<p>Even if one accepts that another cause of impairment causes the delay in interferon production, it is still troubling that this production can be completed correctly when the two causes are superimposed (viral infection and external cause), in a manner precise enough to keep the number of virions limited to one or a few copies per cell. On the other hand, the hypothesis of a <q>collaboration</q> between the cell and the virus fully justifies the presence of such a mechanism, which then appears as a regulatory system rather than a defense system.<h3 id=autoimmune-mechanisms class=headings><a href=#autoimmune-mechanisms>Autoimmune mechanisms</a></h3><p>The display of certain proteins by cells, which occurs under the influence of interferon (e.g. the p69 protein displayed by pancreatic cells), could have the function of triggering auto-immune mechanisms designed to eliminate cells invaded by excessive quantities of foreign molecules. Thus, letting the virus program the return to integrity of the least affected cells, the immune system would take charge of eliminating the cells that are too severely encumbered and should be replaced. This hypothesis would be confirmed if it could be demonstrated that the display in question is proportional to the concentration of foreign molecules in the cell.<h3 id=perfection-of-virion-structures class=headings><a href=#perfection-of-virion-structures>Perfection of virion structures</a></h3><p>The construction of perfectly structured virions and their expulsion through the cell membrane is the result of a coordinated action, which is very complex if we consider the mechanisms involved. This action is programmed by the viral genome in a surprisingly targeted manner. It seems less risky to attribute its origin to the cellular genome, which has the necessary mass of information, than to a mutation-selection process at the level of the viral particle. This process can only start when the virus is already able to reproduce itself. Insofar as this reproduction can only take place in the cell, it is difficult to see how the phenomenon could have been initiated.<h3 id=conservation-of-viral-information class=headings><a href=#conservation-of-viral-information>Conservation of viral information</a></h3><p>The fact that the viral information is stored in the cell and hidden, with the possibility of being reactivated, seems more logical if one postulates that it is useful information, allowing the cell to ensure the evacuation of certain harmful molecules, even if it means reactivating the process at the moment when their accumulation becomes detrimental.<p>The classical view of the virus as a simple pathogen would suggest that virions and their genetic content are totally destroyed after recovery, at least in the most resistant individuals. However, the persistence of viral information actually is the rule.<p>If it has not yet been possible to identify the factors likely to trigger the reactivation of the viral process, it is perhaps precisely because they involve not only the biological data of the virus and the cell, but also the biochemical properties of molecules whose existence has not been taken into consideration until now.<h3 id=bacterial-symbiosis class=headings><a href=#bacterial-symbiosis>Bacterial Symbiosis</a></h3><p>The bacterial infections that we often see associated with viral diseases could be explained not only by a weakening of the immune system, but by the presence in the circulating masses of foreign molecules rejected by the cells.<p>Two hypotheses are therefore possible: either these foreign molecules weaken the organism and open the way to bacterial invasion. Or the multiplication of certain bacteria would also be programmed by the viral information in interaction with the genetics of the organism.<p>This second explanation is not absurd: the foreign molecules whose presence we postulate escape by definition from the mechanisms of assimilation as well as from the vigilance of the immune system, since they have been able to reach the interior of the cells without ambiguity; their elimination thus requires mechanisms which do not belong to the organism itself, for example bacterial enzymes able to degrade the undesirable molecules.<p>This model of reasoning is in agreement with what we know about the bacterial flora: there too, the organism seems to have been able to <q>domesticate</q> bacteria whose enzymes allow it to degrade molecules that escape its own enzymes, for example carbohydrate chains like cellulose.<p>Thus, the virus would induce not only the processes necessary to maintain intracellular integrity, but also the multiplication of bacteria capable of degrading the waste products rejected by the cells. The apparent pathogenicity of these bacteria could be attributed less to the virulence of particular strains than to an excessive level of target molecules in the circulating masses.<h3 id=apoptosis class=headings><a href=#apoptosis>Apoptosis</a></h3><p>Apoptosis, the process of natural cell death observed, for example, in T4 lymphocytes in the presence of HIV, would have the following meaning in this conception: the virus would program the suppression of lymphocytes in charge of recognizing classes of bacteria, whose enzymes are required to degrade the molecules rejected by the cells, so as to favor the multiplication of these bacteria. The viral genetic information would thus program the transport of foreign molecules out of the cells while bacterias multipliply likely to rid the circulating masses of them on the other.<p>Under the effect of an exaggerated concentration of target molecules, especially when molecules of the same type are brought in daily by unsuitable food, it would make sense in this hypothesis that apoptosis exceeds the correct limits, and the immune system enters a state of apparent deficiency, letting all sorts of pathogenic elements develop freely.<p>Autoimmune mechanisms, triggered by the presence of food-borne antigens also bind to lymphocyte membranes, could complicate the phenomenon and aggravate the destruction of these cells.<h3 id=difference-in-evolution class=headings><a href=#difference-in-evolution>Difference in evolution</a></h3><p>The more or less severe evolution of the viral process in different individuals can be explained by a more or less important accumulation of foreign molecules, according to the different food anamnesis.<p>The symptomatic form that it takes more regularly in the human species would be due to the fact that the food proper to the civilization has considerably moved away from the primitive food which could have determined the evolution of our genetics, and it is unlikely that in a few thousand years the human organism could have adapted genetically to all the new molecules brought by the agricultural and culinary artifices established since the Neolithic.<p>A virus as dangerous as SIV hardly causes any symptoms in monkeys living in their natural environment, nor even HIV in captive chimpanzees fed in a natural way. Since the regulation of viral multiplication depends on the presence of foreign molecules in the body, it is to be expected that additional intake of the same molecules through conventional foods would disrupt the process.<br>According to Burger, the consumption of certain foods by infected subjects during the incubation period would cause an aggravation of the subsequent symptoms, for example in viral hepatitis. From this point of view, it is understandable that the diet prescribed regularly by family doctors to patients with influenza, coryza, hepatitis, etc., has had enough effect to be maintained in the medical tradition.<h3 id=childhood-diseases class=headings><a href=#childhood-diseases>childhood diseases</a></h3><p>The popular wisdom which attributed a utility to the diseases of children, for the majority of viral etiology, is paradoxically justified: the organism equipped with the complements of genetic program brought by the various viruses is better armed against the harmful molecules likely to invade its cells during their existence. This calls into question the fundamental meaning of vaccinations: their usefulness would be to avoid viral invasions that could have serious consequences in the classical food conditions.<br>On the other hand, if Burger&rsquo;s hypothesis were to be confirmed, there would be reason to fear that the absence of the genetic complements provided by common viruses would deprive individuals of the mechanisms provided to ensure the maintenance of the integrity of the cellular environment, with the risk of aggravating degenerative processes and compromising various functions of vital importance.<h3 id=changes-in-the-biotope class=headings><a href=#changes-in-the-biotope>Changes in the biotope</a></h3><p>The expansion of certain viral diseases in wild animals can be explained by changes in the environment, the cultivation of cereals or other mutated plants introducing appreciable quantities of new molecules into the natural food environment (proteins produced following mutations in wheat, for example, accumulating in the body of rodents, then in that of the fox, causing the activation of the rabies virus, which was already present before without causing any particular problems). To this could be added the influence of molecules introduced by industrial waste and pollution.<h3 id=antivirals class=headings><a href=#antivirals>Antivirals</a></h3><p>The relative failure of so-called antiviral molecules can be explained by the difficulty of counteracting vital processes programmed by genetic means. The interactions between the viral genome and the cellular genome take place in the cell nucleus and respond to precise mechanisms, so that it is very difficult to inhibit them without harming the cell at the same time. Such processes probably include self-regulatory or substitution mechanisms intended to guarantee their action, the rebellious nature of which may seem paradoxical as long as their biological purpose cannot be defined.<h3 id=oncogenic-viruses class=headings><a href=#oncogenic-viruses>Oncogenic viruses</a></h3><p>The case of oncogenic viruses occupies a special place; they may always be harmful. However, the multiplication of cells can be useful for various purposes, if only to compensate for cellular destruction due to some cause. It would therefore also be possible to envisage that these viruses provide useful information to the organism, even if this means that they can lead to disastrous results under the effect of certain cofactors.<br>The Epstein-Barr virus only manifests itself as a sarcoma in a very small proportion of infected children, and only in Africa. In addition to genetic predisposition, it would be appropriate to investigate, on the basis of Burger&rsquo;s hypothesis, the presence of certain foreign molecules reaching a particularly high concentration, resulting for example from the dietary habits of young Africans.<h3 id=aids class=headings><a href=#aids>AIDS</a></h3><p>As far as HIV is concerned, it has been admitted that almost all infected persons should develop severe symptoms. Indeed, the evidence so far has confirmed that, with very few exceptions, HIV-positive status will result in a fatal outcome. These facts seem to contradict the previous points. However, the same or similar retroviruses have been found in recent years in many wild animals, which do not seem to show any particular symptoms.<p>The best researchers have come to believe that the pathogenicity of this virus is due rather to some as yet unknown <q>co-factors</q> than to the nature of the virus itself.<p>In Burger&rsquo;s hypothesis, these co-factors could be the molecules that the virus would be responsible for programming the elimination of, present in much greater numbers in human organisms than in wild animals: the latter feed mainly on natural foodstuffs to which their genetics have been able to adapt since time immemorial, whereas humans regularly absorb traditional foodstuffs that did not exist in the primitive environment, and to which human genetics have hardly had time to readjust.<p>It is therefore to be feared that certain foreign molecules will have the opportunity to accumulate in human cells at concentrations that have never been reached in the history of the species. The viral processes in charge of programming their elimination, in a primitively silent way, would thus be confronted with an unforeseen situation: the abundance of target molecules would disorganize regulatory mechanisms that ensure their proper functioning and would lead to the appearance of dangerous <q>opportunistic infections</q> as a result of an exaggerated multiplication of the associated bacteria.<p>It remains then to explain why this retrovirus, which was perhaps part of the genetic heritage of humanity without signaling itself, as it is the case in animals, would be suddenly out of the shadow of the cellular nuclei to cause a serious epidemic. Among the reasons to be considered are the changes in eating habits, which have been considerable in the last decades, especially in the Third World countries, where Western eating habits spread quite suddenly, as well as new causes of contagion. Once viral multiplication has been triggered, the virus could only improve its <q>performance</q>: the most contagious virions and those causing the most mucous lesions are the ones that multiply preferentially.<br>In addition, organisms no longer in possession of the virus or in which it was more deeply inactivated, had the time to accumulate a particularly high quantity of target molecules. This would explain the particular violence of the viral process, further increased by the daily intake of foodstuffs carrying molecules of the same classes.<h3 id=theoretical-and-empirical-verification class=headings><a href=#theoretical-and-empirical-verification>Theoretical and empirical verification.</a></h3><p>A new theoretical model, in a field as complex and charged with emotional factors as disease and contagion, can only be verified with sufficient hindsight, through the coherence of the reasoning to which it provides the starting point, and above all through the facts.<p>Unfortunately, it is not easy to obtain the publication of new ideas not yet endorsed by the scientific corpus, even if it is only a matter of submitting them to the criticism of specialists. Burger therefore invites all interested researchers to criticize his proposed model in the light of their theoretical knowledge, and all practitioners to observe whether the presumed relationships between patients&rsquo; diets and the evolution of classical viral diseases correspond to possible predictions. He would be glad if those who observe either significant contradictions or concordances could take the trouble to communicate them to him.<p>If Burger&rsquo;s viral model proves successful, it could open up a new avenue of research, especially in the field of AIDS. It would not only be a matter of looking for a vaccine or developing antiviral molecules to deal with the most urgent problems, but also of identifying the molecules of food origin potentially responsible for disrupting the viral process.<p>Dietary measures applied as a preventive measure could consequently improve the future prospects of current seropositive people. The daily intake of foreign molecules may also play a role in the regulation of the viral process. A correction of the food hygiene could, in this hypothesis, improve the fate of the persons already contaminated, and perhaps limit the evolution of the symptoms even after their appearance.<p>It is regrettable that no epidemiological research has been done so far to establish the possible existence of a relationship between the dietary history of HIV-positive persons or the daily diet of AIDS patients and the severity of symptoms.<p>Furthermore, the identification of food-borne xenobiotics could lead to a better understanding of the cause of many dysfunctions affecting metabolism or other functions involving biochemical mechanisms, such as the transmission of nerve impulses, DNA replication, etc. Certain proteins contained in wheat gluten (gliadins) seem to aggravate the symptoms of schizophrenia, various Maillard molecules have been shown to be mutagenic, and there are certainly many pathogenic factors still to be discovered in this field.<p>In the same perspective, the heuristic proposed by Burger would lead to a more systematic search for food-borne antigens involved in the genesis of autoimmune diseases. The recent discovery of a peptide in cow&rsquo;s milk, apparently responsible for the reversal of the immune system against the B cells of the pancreas, and opening the way to juvenile diabetes, as well as various experiments on rheumatoid arthritis, improved in some 80% of cases by a diet excluding cow&rsquo;s milk, wheat and their derivatives, go in the same direction.<h2 id=a-fallen-world class=headings><a href=#a-fallen-world>A <em>fallen</em> world</a></h2><h3 id=wild_diseases class=headings><a href=#wild_diseases>The cause of diseases in the wild</a></h3><p>Nature, yet a century, still existed untouched in a few places, and the boundary between the sullied and unsullied was a lot easier to tell. It was exponentially easier yet 60 years ago, to observe in a natural state, in terms of behaviors, diet and health.<br>Today thanks to industrialization the encroaching of men on nature has become nearly total.

A slew of so-called experts (the likes of
<a href=/en/instincto/#the-official-myth>Richard Wrangham</a>) endeavored to undermine those much warranted efforts. Their collective strategy (no conspiracy theory, this required only a common fundamental hate for nature and dishonesty) consists in two principles:<ul><li>falsely representing as <q>natural</q> newly data found in thoroughly damaged environments.<li>providing a hugely biased interpretation and abunding in extremely argumentative theories whose only purpose is <em>to warp public perception of nature into a disease-ridden hellscape of violence and rape</em>.</ul><p>For a few decades science has had a remarkably progressist role on the ecological front as a public institution, furthering the idea that men&rsquo; issues were the product of history, civilization, not of its nature, and that primitive cultures were mostly devoid of our unrest, violence and many of our diseases.<p>We can see a gradual reversal of those considerations from the 90ies, now depicting apes not as wise ancestors living in a constant paradise (which they are, or should be) but as poor creatures bent constantly striving to survive in a dangerous place among predators, pathogens and most of all&mldr; their own peers.

What behaviors should or should not be expected for healthy animals ?<p>Although on a lesser number of patients, we observed the same rapid and complete recovery of animals, mainly farm animals and pets. Invariably an adequate wide food range ensured the swift eradication of parasitoses that no other methods (sometimes even resisting chemical treatments) could get rid of. Typically in the form of crawling neatly packed balls of living (or dead) worms, in feces, showing up in feces, most often no more than a mere few days after stopping cooking completely.<p>The horrible conclusion is obvious: Not only humans, but a big part of the animal world, is suffering from the effect of cooking, low-level pollution and an unbalanced diet due to environmental destruction and reshaping by humans, sometimes for thousands of years, as long as agriculture has been a thing. This impacts as much their behavior as their health. It might apply to environments even tens of miles down a river where cities dump waste in one form or another, and obviously any animal close to human habitations will be susceptible to eating unnatural food items, digging out our shit, etc. This explains the crippling level of parasitism in commensals like foxes, boars, rabbits (dying of toxoplasmose), etc, <em>the closer they live to men</em>.<p>Let us start this study with one species in particular, Gorilla gorilla beringei, or mountain gorillas.<h3 id=the-case-of-mountain-gorillas class=headings><a href=#the-case-of-mountain-gorillas>The case of mountain gorillas</a></h3><figure><figcaption>Very little fruits</figcaption><a role=presentation target=_blank href=/Images/images_article_instincto/gorillas_food_proportion.webp><img src=/Images/images_article_instincto/gorillas_food_proportion_hu9ff6932cbc913dfde4da6c4bd70328ae_94224_800x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp srcset="/Images/images_article_instincto/gorillas_food_proportion_hu9ff6932cbc913dfde4da6c4bd70328ae_94224_800x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 800w, /Images/images_article_instincto/gorillas_food_proportion_hu9ff6932cbc913dfde4da6c4bd70328ae_94224_604x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 604w, /Images/images_article_instincto/gorillas_food_proportion_hu9ff6932cbc913dfde4da6c4bd70328ae_94224_400x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 400w, /Images/images_article_instincto/gorillas_food_proportion_hu9ff6932cbc913dfde4da6c4bd70328ae_94224_200x0_resize_q95_h2_lanczos_2.webp 200w" loading=lazy alt="Mountain gorillas&rsquo; food pyramids" title="Very little fruits" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, (max-width: 600px) 50vw, 400px" width=800px height=367px style=--height-limit:367px></a></figure><p>Mountain gorilla have remarkably low levels of either tooth decay or diseases, despite a rate of inbreeding superior to anything we know in human population, to the point of all mountain gorillas being as closely related as half-siblings (35% homozygosity).

Within mountain and eastern lowland gorilla individuals, chromosomes are typically homozygous over one-third of their length (on average 34.5% and 38.4%, respectively) (Fig. 2B), much higher than in western lowland individuals (13.8%) and exceeding even the most inbred human populations (18). We observed longer tracts in the eastern species, particularly in mountain gorillas, and a clear distinction in tract length distribution between eastern lowland and mountain gorillas (fig. S15) (15). Very long tracts (2.5 to 10 Mb) are particularly indicative of recent inbreeding, and homozygosity on this scale in mountain gorillas exceeds not only that in other gorilla populations but also that observed in the Altai Neandertal (19), consistent with parental relatedness equivalent to that between two half-siblings (19). These data suggest that mountain gorillas may have experienced several recent generations of close inbreeding.<p>As judged from the date when inferred Ne began to differ, the divergence of eastern and western gorillas began at least 150,000 years ago, but a more direct analysis using male X-chromosomal sequences suggests that they exchanged genetic material until around 20,000 years ago (Fig. 3B) (15). Given that this also coincides with a notable decline in western lowland gorilla Ne (Fig. 3A), <em>it may be that environmental changes during the Last Glacial Maximum (26,000 to 19,000 years ago), when dry savannah replaced tropical forest over much of the Congo basin (21),</em> triggered a collapse in the western population and complete separation of the two species.<p>Researching for calories intake would be tedious (and too variable) so I&rsquo;ll keep with food weight instead: in our experience men normally eat (at most) between 1.7 and 2kg per day.

Reserves and national parks are slightly too heavily <q>managed</q> and the impact this fact has on animals&rsquo; health depends on whether or not they feed them, information typically not mentioned. In some cases we do know, and it does nothing to reduce our suspicions for the general case, <strong>because no one gives a damn.</strong><sup id=fnref:5><a href=#fn:5 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>5</a></sup><p>I believe <q>true</q> nature has become rare even in Africa, let alone Europe and Asia (more heavily cultivated and populated regions, for a longer time as well), explaining both the prevalence of parasitism and unadaptive behaviors as both indicate a poor constitutive health caused by impoverished habitats. It ensues that no study in ethology (science of animal behavior) or even biology when it comes to parasites and viruses can be trusted anymore, for almost no one take into consideration the impact of a poor food range (nor often has any idea what the animal&rsquo;s <strong>original</strong> environment should be !), the stress level and physiological that it caused.<p>It seems that zoos still give them a lot of vegetables so counting calories is not possible, but their wide variation in body weight along with the horrible preparations primates are given in zoos, should eliminate all questioning about the cause of any disease every reported in zoo animals:<blockquote><p>Diets offered to juvenile gorillas would follow the same general category proportions (50% produce – 15% fruit, 35% vegetable for increased palatability when introducing solid foods), 25% green leafy produce and/or browse, approximately 18% high fiber primate biscuit, 2% cereal grains, nuts or seeds, and up to 5% animal-based products including milk.

In general, primates can be fed a diet based on commercial monkey biscuits, high-fiber, old world and new world primate pellets, or canned primate diet. The appalling poverty of their diet and the fact they eat <strong>cooked food</strong> automatically discard any study whatsoever done on animals fed by humans. The same can be said of any primate species under human custody. Depending on the place and number of animals concerned, reserve animals may or may not be fed. However they will suffer regardless of a lack of variety, as reserves struggle politically to maintain both resources and acreages.<p>Forest fragmentation is a dire issue for animals, as it inhibits the natural circulation of seeds and fruit species, sometimes forcing apes to scout in cultivated areas for more food, leading to aberrations. While gorillas are very flexible and their diet reflect the available food, <em>regardless of subspecies the more fruits available the more fruits they will not only eat but seek preferently</em>.<br>Due to both human encroachment into their original habitat and most likely the effect of climate change since the end of the last Ice Age (at the Younger Dryas circa 10ky BCE), those gorillas were forced to migrate into widely unsuitable climatic zones with very little fruit.<p>Experts argued that the over-eating we observe for mountain gorillas is explained by the low nutritional quality of the plants they have access to.

Chimpanzees and lowland gorillas on the other hand having as many fruits they want are as versatile, can make-do with just a few fruit species sometimes depending on the season, without sign of lacking. They do not have to constantly collect <strong>dozens upon dozens</strong> of different innutritious fibrous plants - and <em>being very specific about which parts</em>.<p>Literature<sup id=fnref:8><a href=#fn:8 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>8</a></sup> show that gorillas do not eat as much fruit as chimpanzees but less out of choice, as because of the environment. While placed in similar environments, they eat similar amounts of fruit. To think diseases is natural because apes should be fine with <strong>some</strong> fruits is nothing butretarded (not nearly as much as us) is eminently dishonest. We evolved <em>along <strong>millions</strong></em> of years along a certain range of environmental variation and this cannot be offset in a mere decades, or centuries, or even tens of thousands of years.<p>Outside that range we may survive but in suboptimal conditions. Studies seem to agree that <strong>mountain</strong> Gorillas came to these altitudes due to climate change since the last ice age, an unfortunate event as a duration of 10 000 years pales in comparison of the millions evolution requires regards to the digestive system and dentition.<p>In those conditions to conserve animals in their <q>natural</q> environment is foolish and even criminal in case of endangered animals (<em>as are most apes</em>). The environment change faster than animals can adapt ergo <em>if we want pandas and apes <strong>to not die</strong></em>, we should relocalise them in <strong>rich</strong> environments, with a wide range of fruits and prey.<p>It also entails that no conclusion whatsoever can be taken from apes in captivity given what they are fed. Captive chimpanzees fare no differently. I do not know natural reserves&rsquo; animals, as many of them are <q>managed</q>, especially for populations extensively studied. But considering the extent of the <em>Ebola crisis</em> I can not help but conclude that <em>they too, must eat shit</em>. And the amount of human interference does not matter.

We view possessing polymorphic sexual instincts (like ours) unrelated to breeding, as evidence of metapsychic evolution, as the potent sexual drive is transcended and put to a better use. While we perceive intelligent yet immoderately unreasonable or vicious species as evolutionary dead-ends in the grand scheme of things. Natural selection might produce all sorts of combinations in terms of species-wide personality traits, instincts and cognitive abilities. Not all of these might make sense on a higher level than the immediate survival of the species.<p>A general capacity for physiological or behavioral adaptations (in one individual or a few generations) like those trees featuring diverse ecotypes for the same genetics depending on the altitude, from small corpses to very tall trees. The issue is, one can assume such adaptations to pack a lot of information, taking a long gradual time to produce&mldr; at initial stages of development a generalist approach to adaptation might be quite poorly responsive to strong selective pressures for immediate survival. And while we tend to expect intelligence to acknowledge intelligence, not consider it as food, but for some species like orcas who allegedly savagely hunt and kill dolphins this might not be always true: intelligence <strong>can</strong> develop in ways barring access to higher forms of love and empathy, let alone [psychic powers.<br>Indeed a hardcoded predatory mindset goes hand in hand with a highly territorial, highly competitive nature, seasonale sexuality matching oestrus cycles closely, fights over partners and few little long-lasting relationships beyond - sometimes - a reproductive couple raising their offspring.<br>Despite boasting a bigger brain than dolphins, orcas match those boxes well, whereas dolphins (while still predating on fish) show both a lot more empathy and social complexity, and a sexuality much the same as bonobos&rsquo;, save for the anatomical differences. Orkas&rsquo;s playful nature with regards to food (much like a cat) hasn&rsquo;t really been observed for dolphins either.<br>Nevertheless, conspecific antisocial behaviors in social species make little sense, as do overt cruelty, in any situation.<p>The bonobo has no significant predator, apart from humans. The leopard does not significantly impact the demography of bonobos, which is entirely regulated by food availability. Since our intelligence has reached a certain threshold, say 1000 cm³ and our mobility with it, the pressure of predators (already low) has completely disappeared. On the contrary, the prey was able to become the top predator with disconcerting ease: nothing is too big for thirty spears, a dam or a forest fire. However, nature did not suffer before 30,000 years and wheelbarrows. Diseases&mldr;
<a href=/en/instincto/#near-elimination>do not exist with instinctonutrition</a>, but that is the theory. What about observations ?<p id=predation_negligeable>Conscientious, intelligent observation demonstrated that humans are responsible, directly and indirectly for <em>halving the mean lifespan of chimpanzees</em>, from about 32 to 15. It applies to apes at minima, but without doubt to all animals for which predation has become negligible relative to their natural life expectancy<sup id=fnref:16><a href=#fn:16 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>16</a></sup>.<br>In 2001, a meta-study summed up and averaged the data concerning mortality over 5 different sites and representing <q>represent 3711 chimpanzee years at risk and 278 deaths</q>, and claimed to have verified statistically an enormous mortality among wild chimpanzees compared to their captive brethrens (giving a lifespan of respectively <strong>15 and 35</strong>). Many of these sites have been the place of poaching and heavy epidemic onsets, both brought by humans.<br>Though not glossing over the very debatable merit of including deaths seemingly so unnatural, the researchers answered with a dumbfoundingly candid answer, claiming that since primitive humans have cohabited with and hunted apes a few times, the deaths due to epidemics and poaching alike should be considered natural. They considered ebola, as natural.<br>And as the icing on the cake, I shall remind you that among these sites, Gombe (Gomb<strong>a</strong> in the text) saw the most violent and vicious chimpanzee <strong>war</strong> ever observed. That alone should have been a red flag, if not for the continuous effort of Wrangham and his ilk to convince the world that bloodlust and rapes had been passed down
<a href=isntincto#wrangham>to humans by chimpanzees</a>. They did acknowledge a significant variation among sites, without detailing. Nor do they detail the different means obtained by removing different sources of mortality. So we were led to conclude that apes led unfairly short and painful lives in the wild, from which they were saved by zoos and closely monitored national parks.<p>Then in 2017 the truth came out<sup id=fnref:17><a href=#fn:17 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>17</a></sup>. It was shown that, besides predation being indeed a non-factor in mortality, under good ecological conditions: The average lifespan reaches similar levels as it does for captive chimpanzees (32 years) and human hunter-gatherers. Considering captive apes&rsquo; constant medical care and humans&rsquo; higher biological lifespan, that says a lot. Infant mortality (first year) was halved compared to Gombe, Mahale, Taï and Bossou, four of the five sites in the previous sample. Epidemics and poaching were absent.<p>In conclusion the authors <em>rightfully attributed this massive health differential to the rich environment the Ngogo community profited from</em>, compared to their neighbors at Kanyawara, and the other four sample communities. Better and richer food make for a stronger immunity, regenerative abilities and assumedly lower stress levels, making abnormalities like the Gombe war unlikely. Apes just should not die from infections, degenerative issues or tumors (the most common causes among captive ones<sup id=fnref:18><a href=#fn:18 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>18</a></sup>). For highly evolved long-lived critters with no predator and inhabiting rich environments, the main source of death, beside infant mortality, should always be slower or faster aging due to individual genetic differences.<p>There is evidence however, that suggests the environment in Ngogo still isn&rsquo;t perfectly pristine. If wide-sweeping epidemics are unknown, diseases aren&rsquo;t<sup id=fnref:19><a href=#fn:19 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>19</a></sup>. If deaths due to diseases seemed both rare and hard to prove, many individuals, especially approaching a <strong>relative</strong> old age (36, despite the older chimp reported reaching the 55), have been shown suffering from respiratory ailments common in all zoos. While individual genetics might play a role, it has been proved that non-lethal but chronic ailments act as sources of metabolic stress, reducing resilience to wounds falls and accelerating aging. The same stress that is known to increase inter-individual aggression, sexual violence, infanticides, etc. Said lethal aggression (mostly toward other communities), without reaching Gombe&rsquo;s levels, seems important in Ngogo<sup id=fnref:20><a href=#fn:20 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>20</a></sup>.<p>From these animals&rsquo; heightened stress levels we can expect environments of lower integrity to foster all the above causes of deaths: adult diseases, excess infant mortality faster aging, con-specific killings or otherwise antisocial instincts going overboard. And since all of these do certainly exist in some (very) limited degree, it ensues that telling apart the natural, genetic components for each rate from the artificial influence, is impossible without a proper theory of <em>what a natural environment means on a <strong>molecular</strong> level</em>.<br>As the very fact of observation (let alone constant monitoring, isolation or care) proves, a pristine nature can never be assumed. Ergo, without knowing beforehand about the natural laws of alimentation, the dependency on observations makes researchers automatically misconstrue the natural state for a given species.<h3 id=ape-violence class=headings><a href=#ape-violence>Ape violence</a></h3><p>In 2004 has been published <em>Lethal aggression in Pan is better explained by adaptive strategies than human impacts</em> by Wrangham & Wilson, according to which the regularity and pattern of killings in chimpanzees reveal a vicious, <q>demonic</q> (the term is theirs) and violent male nature, bent on treating females like resource, and resort to bloodbath whenever it seems advantageous for their selfish interest. Are chimpanzee males driven by the love of their group and the wish to get along like we would expect (a bit naively perhaps ?) any evolved critter (such as intelligent aliens) to behave ?<p>In 2010 as a responses to criticisms regards to these ideas (already quite clear) in <em>Chimpanzee violence is a serious topic: A response to Sussman and Marshack’s critique of Demonic Males: Apes and the Origins of Human Violence</em>, they stated:<blockquote><p>In a survey of nine study communities in the five longest-studied populations of chimpanzees with more than one community, Wrangham et al (2006) reported that the median risk of violent death for chimpanzees from inter-community killing (69-287 per 100,000 per year) fell in the same order of magnitude as the median reported values for rates of death from warfare among subsistence-society <strong>hunters</strong> and farmers (164 and 595 per 100,000 per year, respectively).</blockquote><p>Except the frequency in primitive societies has been very

The forests where mountain gorillas live are surrounded by rapidly increasing human settlement. Through shifting (slash-and-burn) agriculture, pastoral expansion, and logging, villages in forest zones cause fragmentation and degradation of habitat.<br>The late 1960s saw the <em>Virunga Conservation Area (VCA) of Rwanda&rsquo;s national park reduced by more than half of its original size to support the cultivation of Pyrethrum</em>. This led to a massive reduction in mountain gorilla population numbers by the mid-1970s. The resulting deforestation confines the gorillas <strong>to isolated deserts</strong>. <em>Some groups may raid crops for food</em>, creating further animosity and retaliation.</blockquote><blockquote>We used microsatellite genotypes from museum specimens and contemporary samples of Cross River gorillas to infer both the long-term and recent population history. We find that Cross River gorillas diverged from the ancestral western gorilla population ~17,800 years ago (95% HDI: 760, 63,245 years). However, gene flow ceased only ~420 years ago (95% HDI: 200, 16,256 years), <strong>followed by a bottleneck beginning ~320 years ago (95% HDI: 200, 2,825 years) that caused a 60-fold decrease in the effective population size of Cross River gorillas</strong>. Direct comparison of heterozygosity estimates from museum and contemporary samples suggests a loss of genetic variation over the last 100 years.<br>The composite history of western gorillas could plausibly be explained by climatic oscillations inducing environmental changes in western equatorial Africa that would have allowed gorilla populations to expand over time but ultimately isolate the Cross River gorillas, which thereafter exhibited a dramatic population size reduction. <em>The recent decrease in the Cross River population is accordingly most likely attributable to increasing anthropogenic pressure over the last several hundred years</em>.<br>Given that this also coincides with a notable decline in western lowland gorilla Ne, <em>it may be that environmental changes during the Last Glacial Maximum (26,000 to 19,000 years ago), when dry savannah replaced tropical forest over much of the Congo basin (21),</em> triggered a collapse in the western population and complete separation of the two species.</blockquote>&#160;<a href=#fnref:2 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a><li id=fn:3><blockquote><p>Years of civil unrest in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) have taken their toll on both the eastern lowland gorilla and the mountain gorilla.

Ngogo data, which were not then available, are consistent with this argument. Exposure to pathogens carried by humans is relatively low at Ngogo and is probably lower than at Kanyawara, where the chimpanzees often raid crops (Wilson et al., 2014). Also, the Ngogo study area has suffered relatively little recent human disturbance. In fact, <em>considerable forest regeneration in former anthropogenic grasslands has occurred in the Ngogo chimpanzee community territory since we began our study</em>.<p>Life expectancy at birth (e0) for both sexes combined was 32.8 years. It was higher for females (35.8) than for males (29.6); this sex difference remained throughout life. Life expectancy at birth for Ngogo chimpanzees falls within the range of human hunter-gatherers and <em>is similar to values for the Hadza</em>, for whom life expectancy at birth is 35.5 for females and 30.8 for males. <em>At 5 years of age, by which time Ngogo infants are typically weaned, future life expectancy was 36.5 years for the combined sample, 41.9 years for females, and 31 years for males</em>.<br>These increases relative to life expectancy at birth are due to the concentration of early mortality in year 1.

A few individuals who died around the same time also had respiratory infections, and some of those (e.g., male BE, 36 years old) looked weak and emaciated when last seen. Other chimpanzees were noticeably ill when last seen, and we assume that disease and/or the general effects of senescence are common sources of mortality. Male GZ apparently died from a fall because his body was found at the base of a tree e and D. Watts and J. Mitani saw an infant fall to its death as its mother fled from a male who was charging in the top of the canopy. Three females have been seen carrying dead infants presumed to have <em>died of disease</em>, but observers were unable to recover the bodies. Five infants (three of them first-born and two second-born to their respective mothers) have been victims of <em>within-community infanticides</em>, and one was a suspected victim of between-community infanticide.</blockquote>&#160;<a href=#fnref:19 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a><li id=fn:20><blockquote><p>Between-group aggression is likely to be a major source of mortality.

Observers found the bodies of three Ngogo males (estimated ages 18, 23, and 32 years) who had been lethally attacked by neighbors, and we suspect that seven or more adolescent and adult males, who often ranged in peripheral parts of the Ngogo territory, like- wise were victims of such attacks. A 22 year-old male was a victim of lethal within-community coalitionary aggression. In 2004, female DAN suffered serious wounds most likely inflicted by males from a neighboring community during a presumed attempted infanticide. Her 1-year old infant looked only slightly wounded, but DAN and the infant disappeared shortly after the attack.</blockquote>&#160;<a href=#fnref:20 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></ol></div><hr><footer id=footer role=contentinfo>Related content:<menu><li><a href=/en/instincto/>Cooking: An original sin</a><p>The introduction of cooked food has been the greatest catastrophe for 50 000 years: it is the key to everything, in our ancient past and future.</menu><menu><li><a href=/en/eugenics/>Eugenics</a><p>To bring back our species to its ancestral state of biological perfection, we must understand why eugenic policies of the past centuries failed, and go beyond.</menu><menu><li><a href=/en/incest/>Incest: a divine order</a><p>Incest is the highest expression of self-love, the very drive of racial evolution.
